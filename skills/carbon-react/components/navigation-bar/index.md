Then the `orientation` relative to the top/bottom can be offset using the `offset` prop.

[MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-content) |  |
| alignItems | ResponsiveValue<CSS.Property.AlignItems, ThemeType> \| undefined | No |  | The CSS align-items property sets the align-self value on all direct children as a group.

| alignSelf | ResponsiveValue<CSS.Property.AlignSelf, ThemeType> \| undefined | No |  | The align-self CSS property aligns flex items of the current flex line overriding the align-items value. If any of the item's cross-axis margin is set to auto, then align-self is ignored. In Grid layout align-self aligns the item inside the grid area.

| flexShrink | ResponsiveValue<CSS.Property.FlexShrink, ThemeType> \| undefined | No |  | The flex-shrink CSS property sets the flex shrink factor of a flex item.

| flexWrap | ResponsiveValue<CSS.Property.FlexWrap, ThemeType> \| undefined | No |  | The flex-wrap CSS property sets whether flex items are forced onto one line or can wrap onto multiple lines.
