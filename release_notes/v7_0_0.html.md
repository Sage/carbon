# v7.0.0 (2019-04-01)
### Improvements
*  Improvements to the Tooltip decorator
Allowing anyone who is interacting with a html element using the tooltip decorator to move their mouse from the element they are hovering over into the tooltip.
While the mouse is inside of the tooltip or the html element wrapped in the decorator, the tooltip will remain visible.
When moving the mouse out of the tooltip or the html element wrapped in the decorator, the tooltip will close. 

### Breaking Changes
* We have removed Flux and the utils supporting flux. These are now available in a new npm module carbon-state-management.
