## Text Editor

VS Code is our preferred text editor and is available to be downloaded from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). We advise that you follow the installation instructions provided by Microsoft. The VS Code installation instructions can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac) for Mac users and [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows) for Windows users.

### Useful Extensions to Install

You can browse and install extensions from within VS Code. Simply bring up the Extensions view by clicking on the [Extensions icon](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/editor/extension-gallery/extensions-view-icon.png) in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code or the View: Extensions command (⇧+⌘+X) on Mac or (shift+alt+x) on Windows.

To install an extension, click the Install button. Once the installation is complete, the Install button will change to the Manage gear button.

Below we have compiled a list useful extensions to complement our development work with the Carbon library.

## Installing Node.js, NPM, and Git 

### Node.js & NPM

The recommended way to install `node` and `npm` is using [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
Once you have installed `nvm` you should run `nvm install lts/fermium` which will install a suitable version of `node` and `npm`.

You can check your installation using `node --version` and `npm --v`.

### Git

To find out if you already have a version of Git installed on your machine, simply run 
`git --version` in your terminal or command line. If you have Git installed, you will receive a console output similar to this: `git version 2.23.0`

If you do not have Git already installed, you can download the latest version of Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

#### New to Git?

If you are new to Git, it can be a little overwhelming at first. Luckily there are a lot of dedicated information and training for Git. Atlassian have an easy to understand and informative article that explains the workflow of Git. This can found [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow). PluralSight also offer excellent training courses ranging from beginner to advanced users. A good place to start is with the [How Git Works](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/how-git-works/table-of-contents) training course. This will start you off with the very basic principles of Git.

#### Git Alias

You need to add the following to ~/.gitconfig
````
[alias]
        pr = "!f() { git fetch -fu ${2:-origin} refs/pull/$1/head:pr/$1 && git checkout pr/$1; }; f"
        pr-clean = "!git checkout master ; git for-each-ref refs/heads/pr/* --format=\"%(refname)\" | while read ref ; do branch=${ref#refs/heads/} ; git branch -D $branch ; done"
````
This allows you to review PRs very easily. For example, if you are reviewing [https://github.com/Sage/carbon/pull/2408/](https://github.com/Sage/carbon/pull/2408/), you can use `git pr 2408` which will check out a new branch named pr/2408. This gives you the ability to review, change branches, merge and make experimental changes. The second command `git pr-clean` removes all branches that start with pr/. This is a useful for housekeeping of branches.

#### GPG Verification

We encourage our contributors to verify their commits with a GPG key. Follow these instructions to enable GPG commit signing: [https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification)

Then add this to your profile (i.e`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`) so `gpg-agent` can prompt for your passphrase:

`export GPG_TTY=$(tty)`

Then execute this command to sign all of your commits by default:

`$ git config --global commit.gpgsign true`

Restart of gpg-agent may be required. Use the command below to kill it (it will start next time its needed):

`$ gpgconf --kill gpg-agent`
