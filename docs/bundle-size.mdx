# Bundle size

How to minimize bundle size.

## Tree shaking

Tree shaking in Carbon should work out of the box as long as you're using a bundler that supports ES6 modules and tree shaking. There is no need to change the import paths of the components.
Considering that all components should be imported more or less as shown below:

```jsx
import Component from "carbon-react/lib/components/component";
import {
  SubComponent1,
  SubComponent2,
} from "carbon-react/lib/components/other-component";
```

To make sure that your webpack config supports tree shaking ensure that none of these optimization options are turned off.
These values are set to `true` by default.

```jsx
//webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  //...
  optimization: {
    usedExports: true,
    sideEffects: true,
    innerGraph: true,
  },
};
```

For more information about the topic see the [webpack guide to tree shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/).
