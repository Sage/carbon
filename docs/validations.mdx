## Carbon validation overview

Input components in Carbon have built-in validation states, which can be used to provide feedback to users about the state of their input. 
These states can indicate whether the input is valid or not, and can also prevent form submission if the input is invalid.

### Validation redesign

Carbon is in the process of implementing a new validation pattern to our input components. To opt into this new pattern, you can set the 
`validationRedesignOptIn` flag to true in the [CarbonProvider](../?path=/docs/carbon-provider--docs).

Component props that are not supported if the opt-in flag is set to true are labelled as [Legacy] in their corresponding prop tables. 
These props should not be used if the new validation pattern is being used.

**Note:** This new pattern **does not** support inline labels/legends, this means that any related props will not have any effect or may have unexpected behaviour. 

In components where the new validation pattern has not been implemented, the default validation pattern is still available, even if the opt in flag has been set to true.

#### Validation redesign states

- **error** - meant to be a blocking validation, styles the input with a 2px wide red border along with a red border on the left side of the component and a validation message if provided.
- **warning** - meant to be a non-blocking validation, displays an orange border on the left side of the component and a validation message if provided.

Input hints are used instead of Help tooltips to provide additional information about the input. A new `inputHint` prop has been added to support this, however, 
in some components the `labelHelp` prop has been repurposed to function as an input hint.

### Validation states

Carbon supports three validation states:

- **error** - meant to be a blocking validation, displays 2px wide red border and validation icon if message is provided.
- **warning** - meant to be a non-blocking validation, displays 1px wide orange border and validation icon if message is provided.
- **info** - meant to be a non-blocking validation, displays 1px wide blue border and validation icon if message is provided.

### Input validation

Each input component that supports validations accepts the following props - `error`, `warning` or `info`.

Passing a `string` to these props will display a border along with a validation icon and tooltip; this `string` value will be displayed as the tooltip message.

<Canvas of={ValidationsStories.StringValidation} />

Passing a `boolean` to these props will display a border and validation icon without the additional tooltip information.

<Canvas of={ValidationsStories.BooleanValidation} />

The only exception from this is the `DateRange` component which displays separate validation statuses on either `start` or `end` dates - 
to achieve this the `DateRange` component accepts `startError`, `endError`, `startWarning`, `endWarning`, `startInfo` and `endInfo` props.

### Grouped inputs validation

Grouping components like `RadioButtonGroup`, `CheckboxGroup` and `SimpleColorPicker` support validations too.

<Canvas of={ValidationsStories.GroupedInputValidation} />

Passing validation props on a group component will display a validation icon on the group label/legend and apply proper styles to the grouped inputs.

<Canvas of={ValidationsStories.GroupedLegendValidation} />

The `required` prop can also be passed to the group component and the required attribute will be passed down to the child components.

<Canvas of={ValidationsStories.GroupedRequired} />

### Validation icon placement

Most of the input components support two variants of validation icon placement:

- by the component or next to it - default behaviour
- next to the component label or legend

To decide which placement is preferred `validationOnLabel` or `validationOnLegend` props can be used.

### Form component

Carbon provides a Form component which augments an HTML `<form>` element with:

- footer - a container for rendering "Save", "Cancel" and other custom buttons; it can also be made sticky if wanted
- validation summary - graphical indicator of errors and warnings

## Formik overview

> Formik keeps track of your form's state, and then exposes it (plus a few reusable methods and event handlers) to your
> form via props. [🔗](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/overview#the-gist)

Formik provides a small set of React components and hooks, of which the key ones are:

- [**Formik**](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/formik) - The central component of Formik, which wraps an
  HTML form, and accepts props such as
  [initialValues](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/formik#initialvalues-values),
  [onSubmit()](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/formik#onsubmit-values-values-formikbag-formikbag-void),
  [validate()](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/formik#validate-values-values-formikerrors-values-promise-any)
  and [validationSchema()](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/formik#validationschema-schema-schema). It
  provides form state information (such as
  [values](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/formik#values-field-string-any),
  [dirty](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/formik#dirty-boolean),
  [errors](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/formik#errors-field-string-string) and
  [isValid](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/formik#isvalid-boolean)) and action methods (such as
  [validateForm()](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/formik#validateform-values-any-promise-formikerrors-values),
  [validateField()](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/formik#validatefield-field-string-void) and
  [setValues()](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/formik#setvalues-fields-field-string-any-void)).
- [**Form**](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/form),
  [**Field**](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/field),
  [**ErrorMessage**](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/errormessage) - Helper components (powered by
  [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)) which reduce boilerplate code.
- [**useField()**](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/api/useField) - A hook to help with building reusable input
  primitive components.

**Note:** Formik is only intended to be used with
[controlled components](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components), where the component's state is
controlled by supplying a `value` prop (or a `checked` prop for `radio` and `checkbox`). Technically it's possible to
use Formik with [uncontrolled components](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html) (by not supplying a
controlling `value`/`checked` prop, and only supplying `name` `onChange` `onBlur` props), but this is strongly
**discouraged** ⚠️.

### Form validation using Formik

Formik supports three kinds of validation:

1. [**Form-level: plain**](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/guides/validation#validate) - A `values` object is
   passed to a `validate()` function which implements its own custom validation logic and returns an `errors` object.
2. [**Form-level: schema-based**](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/guides/validation#validationschema) - Performs
   validation using a [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) schema.
3. [**Field-level**](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/guides/validation#field-level-validation) - Separate
   `validate()` functions are supplied for each form field.

## Code examples

### Form validation using Field-level validation with Formik and Yup

See the [example codesandbox code](https://codesandbox.io/s/carbon-with-formik-new-example-2cqdxm?file=/src/App.tsx) showing how to
integrate various different Carbon components into Formik/Yup.

Note the following points about the implementation:

- Carbon components are wrapped in [Formik's Field component](https://formik.org/docs/api/field), passing the actual Carbon component as the `as` prop.
- A `validate` prop is also required as well as warning/error/info props as appropriate to pass to the Carbon component. In the example these have been
  returned from a custom Hook that takes the Yup validation schemas - this should be adapted to your actual use case if not appropriate.
- Note the use of an explicit `checked` prop on the checkbox and switch components, with `value` set to a hardcoded string. This is required for these
  checkbox-based components to work properly (Formik `Field` by default will try to pass `value` but `checked` is the important property on these components,
  with `value` having no purpose other than allowing the field to be identified on the server side after form submission).
- Date-related components require more careful handling - an explicit `onChange` is required that calls Formik's `setFieldValue` function with the
  `formattedValue` property of the custom event object's `target`.
- There is also a custom Yup transform to ensure the date is parsed in `dd/MM/yyyy` format, which is the default for Carbon date components but not accepted
  by Yup. The implementation in the sandbox uses the `date-fns` library but you can use whichever date-parsing library you choose, and of course use whichever
  date-format is appropriate to the locale you're using.
- `DateRange` requires particularly special handling, as this is a single Carbon component which renders 2 separate HTML input fields. In the example
  this is done by using a modified form of the custom hook mentioned above that returns two separate prop objects, one for each input, and passes them
  down using `startDateProps` and `endDateProps`. Note the way these prop objects are generated to ensure validation messages, possibly of different types,
  can be supplied to each input where appropriate (this is also why the `abortEarly` Yup validation option is set to false).
  Similarly, the validation function and the custom `onChange` need to ensure they cover both fields individually.
