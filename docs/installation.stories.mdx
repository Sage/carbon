## Main installation

Carbon is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/carbon-react). To install it into your project run the following command:

```shell
npm install carbon-react
```

## Peer dependencies

You will need to install the following dependencies in your project, these are peer-dependencies of Carbon and are required.

```shell
npm install @sage/design-tokens@^4.0 react@^17.0 react-dom@^17.0 styled-components@^4.4.1
```

Carbon uses [draft-js](https://draftjs.org/) for the `TextEditor` or `Note` components. If you plan on using these components in your project, run the following to install the package:

```shell
npm install draft-js
```

## Fonts and icons

Carbon requires the `Sage UI` and `CarbonIcons` fonts to display correctly. The CSS font face definitions are included in Carbon and can be imported directly in either your entry-point CSS:

```css
/* Import Sage UI and CarbonIcons fonts */
@import "~carbon-react/lib/style/fonts.css";
```

or your entry-point JavaScript:

```js
// Import Sage UI and CarbonIcons fonts
import "carbon-react/lib/style/fonts.css";
```

### Assets

The font and icon assets themselves will **not** be automatically handled by Carbon, so you will be required to load these into your application yourself through your build system.

Your build system must support CSS and file loading for this to work, e.g. `webpack` with `css-loader` and `file-loader`. This is pre-configured if you are using `create-react-app`, but it is possible to use other bundling solutions such as [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) if you wish.

Note the `Sage UI` font assets themselves are provided by the [@sage/design-tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sage/design-tokens) library. If this has not been installed in your project beforehand, text will be rendered in the browser's default sans-serif font.
