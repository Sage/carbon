## Try Carbon

You don't need to install anything to experiment with Carbon. Try playing with this live sandbox:

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/Parsium/carbon-starter)

Or try Carbon locally on your computer, by [downloading or git cloning this GitHub template](https://github.com/Parsium/carbon-starter).

> NOTE: You need to install **Node.js** and **npm** for local development.

## Starting a new Carbon project

Carbon is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/carbon-react). To install it into your project run the following command:

```shell
npm install carbon-react
```

### Peer dependencies

You will need to install the following dependencies in your project, as they are required for Carbon to work:

```shell
npm install @sage/design-tokens@^4.0 react@^18.0 react-dom@^18.0 styled-components@^5.3.11
```

### Fonts and icons

Carbon uses **Sage UI** font by default, or a fallback Sans-Serif font if it cannot find it. **Carbon does not come with Sage UI built in**, so make sure you have `@sage/design-tokens` installed as it provides the font assets:

```shell
npm install @sage/design-tokens@^4.0
```

For icons, Carbon comes with its own icon font out of the box, **CarbonIcons**, which is utilised by many Carbon components.

To load both Sage UI and CarbonIcons into your project, add the following import to your entry-point CSS:

```css
/* Import Sage UI and CarbonIcons fonts */
@import "~carbon-react/lib/style/fonts.css";
```

or this import to your entry-point JavaScript:

```js
// Import Sage UI and CarbonIcons fonts
import "carbon-react/lib/style/fonts.css";
```

#### Self-storing font assets

If you intend to store the static Sage UI and CarbonIcons font assets directly in your own project, be aware **you will required to load these directly into your project yourself via your web bundler or build system**. Many popular web bundlers should have advice on how to achieve this:

- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-modules/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#static-assets)
