## Upcoming activity

Listed below is the activity we have on our backlog.

### Move experimental folder

Move the experimental components into the main components folder and remove the experimental folder.

### Internationalisation

Implement the proposal in the [i18n RFC](https://github.com/Sage/carbon/blob/master/rfcs/text/i18n.md).

### TypeScript Support

At a minimum we should support type definitions for every component.
We will also review if we should convert our existing code to TypeScript.

### Accessibility audit

Review current components against accessibility guidelines and plug any gaps we may have to meet those requirements, in particular:

1. Keyboard accessibility of navigation components such as Menu.
1. Keyboard accessibility of Tables - particularly tables with inputs.
1. Focus behaviour in Dialog and Sidebar.
1. Date picker popover.

Review our automation/testing/linting to ensure that accessibility is part of the CI process to prevent any regressions.

### Design System congruence

Review our Design System documentation and ensure our components are congruent with those described in [brand.sage.com](https://brand.sage.com).

### Deprecations

Deprecation of components that are no longer actively maintained.

1. Multi Step Wizard
1. Row and Column
