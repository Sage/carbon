## Quick start

A basic project `index.(jsx|tsx)` file would resemble this example:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import CarbonProvider from "carbon-react/lib/components/carbon-provider";
import GlobalStyle from "carbon-react/lib/style/global-style";
import sageTheme from "carbon-react/lib/style/themes/sage";
import "carbon-react/lib/style/fonts.css";
import Typography from "carbon-react/lib/components/typography";

const App = (props) => {
  return (
    <CarbonProvider theme={sageTheme}>
      <GlobalStyle />
      <Typography>Hello Carbon</Typography>
    </CarbonProvider>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("app"));
```

## Globals

### Global styles

We recommend using our global stylesheet, which can be used by including the global `GlobalStyle` component within your app like so:

```ts
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import GlobalStyle from 'carbon-react/lib/style/global-style';

ReactDOM.render(
  <CarbonProvider>
    <GlobalStyle/>
    ...
  </CarbonProvider>
, ...);
```

### Theming

Carbon supports two theming systems - the latest which uses Design Tokens in form of CSS custom properties maintained by designers, and legacy themes which use old theme properties from the ThemeProvider from the [styled-components library](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced#theming). Currently both systems are being supported to aid projects using older versions of Carbon with upgrading.

The themes available in Carbon include:

- **sage** - the latest theme which uses Design Tokens in form of CSS custom properties. _Note this theme requires installation of `@sage/design-tokens` library, otherwise styles fallback to the old mint theme for compatibility._
- **mint**, **aegean** and **none** - legacy themes that use old theme properties consumed by [ThemeProvider from the styled-components library](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced#theming).

To supply the theme styles to your components, you can pass them via the [Carbon Provider](../?path=/docs/carbon-provider--docs).

### Localisation

We also provide a `i18nProvider` global for handling different locales. For more information on how to use this in your app, [see our i18n docs](../?path=/docs/documentation-i18n--docs).
