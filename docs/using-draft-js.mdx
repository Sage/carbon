## Installation

The [TextEditor](../?path=/docs/text-editor--docs) and
[Note](../?path=/docs/note--docs) components utilise the `Draft.js` framework to
support creating and rendering rich-text content. As such, the framework has been added as a peer-dependency and
consuming projects are required to install it if they wish to use either component, this can be done as an
[npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/draft-js).

```sh
npm install draft-js@^0.11.5
```

### EditorState

The `EditorState` is an Immutable Record representing the the top-level object for the entire state of the `Editor`.
Interacting with it will provide access to a wide range of useful information. This includes the current text
`ContentState`, accessible via the `getCurrentContent()` method exposed as part of the API. It also provides access to
the current `SelectionState` (`getSelection()`), the fully decorated representation of the contents
(`getCurrentInlineStyle()` and `getBlockTree()`), undo/redo stacks and the most recent type of change made to the
contents. For more information refer to the API documentation https://draftjs.org/docs/api-reference-editor-state.

#### Importing EditorState

The `EditorState` can be imported either directly from `draft-js` or alternatively it has been exposed as part of the
`TextEditor` component's interface.

```js
import { EditorState } from "draft-js";
```

```js
import { TextEditorState } from "carbon-react/lib/components/text-editor";
```

#### Useful static methods

The framework surfaces a range of static methods for initialising the state:

- `EditorState.createEmpty(decorator?: DraftDecoratorType)` - will intitialise the component with a new `EditorState`
  object with an empty `ContentState` and any `Decorators` passed to it.
- `EditorState.createWithContent(contentState: ContentState, decorator?: DraftDecoratorType)` - is used to initialise
  the component with some existing `ContentState` and any `Decorators` and return a new `EditorState` object.
- `EditorState.create(config: EditorStateCreationConfig)` - offers the same as `createWithContent` but enables
  initialising the `EditorState` from a config, affording you more fine grain control. For example, it is possible to
  define an initial `SelectionState` using this static method.

#### Other useful methods

- `EditorState.push(editorState: EditorState, contentState: ContentState, changeType: EditorChangeType)` - it is very
  unlikely that you will have a need to use this but if direct content changes are required they must be applied to the
  `EditorState` using this method. It returns a new `EditorState` object with the specified `ContentState` applied as the
  new currentContent, the `changeType` defines the operation being carried out on the state, see
  https://draftjs.org/docs/api-reference-editor-change-type for the defined options.
- The current `ContentState` can be accessed by calling the `getCurrentContent()` instance method.
- The current `SelectionState` can be accessed by calling the `getSelection()` instance method.

### ContentState

`ContentState` is also an Immutable Record and represents the state of the editor's entire contents (text, block and
inline styles, and entity ranges) and its two selection states (before and after rendering). There are range of useful
methods accessible through `ContentState` that can provide information about the current content rendered in the editor,
for more details it is best to refer to the API reference documentation
https://draftjs.org/docs/api-reference-content-state.

#### Importing ContentState

The `ContentState` can be imported either directly from `draft-js` or alternatively it has been exposed as part of the
`TextEditor` component's interface.

```js
import { ContentState } from "draft-js";
```

```js
import { TextEditorContentState } from "carbon-react/lib/components/text-editor";
```

#### Useful static methods

There are two static methods that facilitate creating `ContentState`:

- `createFromText(text: string, delimiter?: string)` - will generate state from a given string paramater, passing an
  optional delimiter will define how the content blocks are split; if no delimiter is provided the method will default to
  using `\n`. This method will commonly be used with the `createWithContent` method surfaced by the `EditorState` like so:

```js
const Foo = (props) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState(
    EditorState.createWithContent(ContentState.createFromText("text content"))
  );

  return (
    <Editor editorState={state} onChange={(newState) => setState(newState)} />
  );
};
```

- `createFromBlockArray(blocks: Array<ContentBlock>, entityMap: ?OrderedMap)` - this method will produce a
  `ContentState` object from an array of `ContentBlock`s, an optional Immutable map of `DraftEntity` records can also be
  provided as the second argument. A `ContentBlock` is itself an Immutable Record that maintains the following
  information about a block: a string key, the entity type, the block's text and an Immutable characterList which
  maintains the styling and other data for each character. Commonly this method will be used in conjunction with `Draft`'s
  data conversion methods (https://draftjs.org/docs/api-reference-data-conversion), below is an example of using it when
  converting html into `ContentState` using `convertFromHTML`.

```js
  const Foo = (props) => {
    const html = `<p>Lorem ipsum</p>`;
    const blocksFromHTML = convertFromHTML(html);
    const contentState = ContentState.createFromBlockArray(
      blocksFromHTML.contentBlocks,
      blocksFromHTML.entityMap
    );
    const [state, setState] = useState(EditorState.createWithContent(contentState);

    return (
      <Editor editorState={ state } onChange={ (newState) => setState(newState)} />
    );
  };
```
