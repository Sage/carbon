# Roadmap

> **Disclaimer**: We operate in a dynamic commercial environment, and things are subject to change. The information provided is intended to outline the general direction of the library. It's intended for informational purposes only. We may decide to add/remove new items at any time depending on our capability to deliver while meeting our quality standards. The development, releases, and timing of any features or functionality of Carbon remain at the sole discretion of Sage. The roadmap does not represent a commitment, obligation, or promise to deliver at any time.

Alongside regular support, we currently have the below activities on our backlog:

## Accessibility

We are actively working with the community and Sage Accessibility auditors to ensure all Carbon components are accessible to at least [level AA standard of the WCAG 2.1 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

## Replacing `styled-components`

We will eventually retire support for `styled-components` and `styled-system` and investigate alternative tooling such as CSS Modules, with the intention of removing technical debt and improving performance.

## Responsiveness

We will be updating Carbon to ensure all our components natively support mobile devices down to 320px screen width. This will be a large, multi-disciplinary effort with other developers, designers and accessibility auditors to ensure the best solution is offered to Carbon consumers.

## Documentation

We will increase our documentation efforts to ensure that our consumers have a good development experience.
We will consider the language that we use, the examples that we provide and the tooling that we use.
