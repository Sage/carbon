## How localisation works in Carbon 

By default, Carbon uses `en-GB` translations, you can see a preview of these translations here [src/locales/en-gb.ts](https://github.com/Sage/carbon/blob/master/src/locales/en-gb.ts)

To provide Carbon components with localisation support, use the `<I18nProvider />` component. Specific components or an application can be wrapped in the provider to override the default `en-GB` 
locale to provide locale support and translations for an application. To keep track of what needs to be translated use Carbon's translation keys, these keys reference
each individual translation. See a full table of where to find them [here](#where-to-find-translation-keys)
.
```jsx 
import I18nProvider from "carbon-react/lib/components/i18n-provider";
```

The `<I18nProvider />` component can be configured in three ways, the first is by using the default translations provided by Carbon (`en-GB`). Carbon also offers `en-CA`, `en-US`, `de-DE`, `es-ES`, `fr-CA` or 
`fr-FR` locale support. 

**Please note** Carbon can only verify that the `en-GB` locale is contextually and linguistically correct. All other locales are community driven, and Carbon relies on its consuming community to help maintain
and update these locales. To contribute, see the Carbon contributing guide [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Sage/carbon/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), alternatively any issues found can be raised [here](https://github.com/Sage/carbon/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Bug%2Ctriage&projects=&template=bug_report.yml).
If, for any reason a translation is missing, incorrect or not contextually accurate it can be manually overridden.

In the first configuration the `fr-FR` locale is passed directly, which will apply all available translations automatically to components which are wrapped in the provider. 

```jsx
import frFR from "carbon-react/lib/locales";

<I18nProvider locale={frFR}>
  <App />
</I18nProvider>;
```

In the second configuration, the `fr-FR` locale object is still utilised by being spread, so Carbon components are still populated with all the avaiable translations. 
However, specific translations can now be overridden by passing a translation string to a specific locale object, which is useful for use cases where an alternative translation is needed.

```jsx
import frFR from "carbon-react/lib/locales";

<I18nProvider
  locale={{
    ...frFR,
    search: {
      searchButtonText: () => "Rechercher une nouvelle voiture",
    },
  }}
>
  <App />
</I18nProvider>;
```

Also, if necessary the `locale` property can be overridden to pass a specific locale name, in the below example the Swiss French locale is defined (`fr-CH`). This is optional and not necessary, but is
useful to keep track of which specific locale is being applied, especially if like below, it has been used to change specific phrasing in accordance with a language variant.

```jsx
import frFR from "carbon-react/lib/locales";

<I18nProvider
  locale={{
    ...frFR,
    locale: () => "fr-CH"
    search: {
      searchButtonText: () => "Rechercher une nouvelle char",
    },
  }}
>
  <App />
</I18nProvider>;
```

The third and final configuration is where a locale which is not supported by Carbon needs to be implemented. Consumers can pass a specific locale name
via the locale object and provide individual translation strings for all components which require translations.

```jsx
<I18nProvider
  locale={{
    locale: () => "eo",
    dialog: {
      ariaLabels: {
        close: () => "Fermu",
      },
    },
    link: {
    skipLinkLabel: () => "Saltu al ĉefa enhavo",
    },
    password: {
      ariaLiveShownMessage: () =>
        "Via pasvorto estis montrita. Fokusu sur la pasvorta enigo por ke ĝi legu al vi, se estas sekure fari tion.",
      ariaLiveHiddenMessage: () => "Via pasvorto estas nuntempe kaŝita.",
    },
  }}
>
  <App />
</I18nProvider>;
```

## How locales are structured

Every Carbon component which contains a translation, has a corresponding object within every translation file and an individual translation key. The size of this object, and how it is nested depends 
on the design and complexity of the component itself. For example, a simpler locale object like `Loader` only includes one string to be translated, so the respective locale object is relatively 
simple as is the translation key `loader.loading`.

```jsx 
  loader: {
    loading: () => string;
  };
```
However, some Carbon components may have more strings which require translations or more general complexity which may result in a larger, more complex object with more nesting and more translation keys. 

An example of this is the `numeralDate` component. The components corresponding object is split into two, with `labels` and `validation` both being properties of the `numeralDate` object, and both 
having sub-properties of `day` `month` `year`. By separating these properties, the distinction between what each translation does is clear, whilst still having identically named innermost objects. 
Their respective translation keys also follow this format `numeralDate.validation.day` `numeralDate.labels.day`.

```jsx 
  numeralDate: {
    validation: {
      day: (month?: string, daysInMonth?: string) => string;
      month: () => string;
      year: () => string;
    };
    labels: {
      day: () => string;
      month: () => string;
      year: () => string;
    };
  };
```

This modular locale object approach prioritises readability, whilst also making each locale object self-descriptive with clear and concise wording and structure; accompanied with a camel case 
naming convention.

## Parameterised localisation

Some translations need to be translated differently depending on variables or context, this can be achieved with parameterised localisation. In some 
components' locale object, parameters are passed to aid consumers in constructing custom translations via functions and string interpolation. 

The `characterCount` locale object is good example of a parameter being used to provide custom translations. Within the `tooManyCharacters` and `charactersLeft` 
properties two parameters `count` and `formattedCount` are provided. The `count` parameter can be used in a function or ternary operator to calculate pluralisation and `formattedCount`
can be interpolated into the final translation string.

```jsx
  characterCount: {
    tooManyCharacters: (count: number, formattedCount: string) => string;
    charactersLeft: (count: number, formattedCount: string) => string;
    visuallyHiddenHint: (formattedCount: string) => string;
  };
```

In the `tooManyCharacters` property in the `en-GB` translation file, the `count` parameter is used to determine whether a singular or plural string is returned. 
String interpolation is then used to include the formatted count, which results in a properly formatted linguistically accurate final string.

```jsx
 tooManyCharacters: (count, formattedCount) =>
      count === 1
        ? `${formattedCount} character too many`
        : `${formattedCount} characters too many`,
```

This is simple enough for an `en-GB` translation, but other locales may be slightly more complex. For example, wthin the `pl-PL` locale  where, depending on the number of characters 
left, the word for `"characters"` may be formatted differently. 

In the Polish language there is a plural genitive form which is used in specific grammatical contexts, so in this scenario 
singular, plural and plural genitive nouns need to be accounted for. The `count` parameter can be used in a function to calculate the correct noun and ensure a linguistically accurate final string is returned.

```jsx 
export const PolishPlural = (
  singularNominative: string,
  pluralNominative: string,
  pluralGenitive: string,
  value: number
) => {
  if (value === 1) {
    return singularNominative;
  }
  if (
    value % 10 >= 2 &&
    value % 10 <= 4 &&
    (value % 100 < 10 || value % 100 >= 20)
  ) {
    return pluralNominative;
  }
  return pluralGenitive;
};
```
```jsx
  tooManyCharacters: (count, formattedCount) =>
      `Masz o ${formattedCount} ${PolishPlural(
        "znak",
        "znaki",
        "znaków",
        count
      )} za dużo`,

```

## How to stay updated

To stay up to date on any changes to these keys and Carbon's locale files, use a preferred method to watch Carbon's locales files directory to receive automatic alerts regarding any changes made. The following can be added
[https://github.com/Sage/carbon/commits/master/src/locales.atom](https://github.com/Sage/carbon/commits/master/src/locales.atom) to an RSS reader to set up a filter to receive notifications within the `locales` directory.
