### Installation

Carbon is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/carbon-react), install it into your project with:

```js
npm install carbon-react
```

### Peer Dependencies

You will need to install the following dependencies in your project, these are peer-dependencies of carbon-react and are required.

```sh
npm install @sage/design-tokens@^2.3.0 react@^16.14.0 react-dom@^16.14.0 styled-components@^4.4.1
```

There is a peer dependency on `draft-js` any project intending to use either the `TextEditor` or `Note` components is required to install it as well.

```sh
npm install draft-js@^0.11.5
```

#### Global stylesheet

We recommend using our global stylesheet which could be imported:

```
import GlobalStyle from 'carbon-react/lib/style/global-style';
```

then the `GlobalStyle` component could be placed next to the content of the app:

```
  <App>
    <GlobalStyle />
    .
    .
    .
  </App>
```

#### Fonts

Carbon requires the `Sage UI` and `CarbonIcons` fonts to display correctly. These will **_not_** be automatically loaded by Carbon, so you will be required to load these into your application yourself.

Your build system must support CSS and file loading for this to work, e.g. `webpack` with `css-loader` and `file-loader`. This is pre-configured if you are using `create-react-app`, but it is possible to use other bundling solutions such as `parceljs` if you wish.

The font face definitions for both fonts are included in Carbon and can be directly imported into your code using one of the following snippets:

###### Using CSS

```css
/* Import Sage UI and CarbonIcons fonts */
@import "~carbon-react/lib/style/fonts.css";
```

###### Using JavaScript

```js
// Import Sage UI and CarbonIcons fonts
import "carbon-react/lib/style/fonts.css";
```

_Note the `Sage UI` font files themselves are loaded from the [@sage/design-tokens](https://github.com/Sage/design-tokens) library. If this has not been installed in your project beforehand, text will be rendered in the browser's default sans-serif font._

#### React and React DOM

React and React DOM are imported from the [React library](https://reactjs.org/), which forms the basis for Carbon's components.

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
```

### Theming and Design Tokens

Carbon supports two theming systems - the latest which uses Design Tokens in form of CSS custom properties maintained by designers, and legacy themes which use old theme properties from the ThemeProvider from the [styled-components library](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced#theming). Currently both systems are being supported to aid projects using older versions of Carbon with upgrading.

The themes available in Carbon include:

- **sage** - the latest theme which uses Design Tokens in form of CSS custom properties. _Note this theme requires installation of `@sage/design-tokens` library, otherwise styles fallback to the old mint theme for compatability._
- **mint**, **aegean** and **none** - legacy themes that use old theme properties consumed by ThemeProvider.

#### Carbon Provider

Carbon provides the <LinkTo kind="Carbon Provider" story="default">Carbon Provider</LinkTo> component that uses the `ThemeProvider` from the [styled-components library](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced#theming) to supply theme styles to your components. Themes are defined within the Carbon library and can be imported like the following snippet. `mintTheme` is provided by default.

```js
import CarbonProvider from "carbon-react/lib/components/carbon-provider";
import sageTheme from "carbon-react/lib/style/themes/sage";
```

Default `mintTheme`:

```jsx
<CarbonProvider>Children</CarbonProvider>
```

The latest `sageTheme`:

```jsx
<CarbonProvider theme={sageTheme}>Children</CarbonProvider>
```

#### Quickstart

A basic project `index.js` file would resemble this example.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import CarbonProvider from "carbon-react/lib/components/carbon-provider";
import GlobalStyle from "carbon-react/lib/style/global-style";
import sageTheme from "carbon-react/lib/style/themes/sage";
import "carbon-react/lib/style/fonts.css";
import Box from "carbon-react/lib/components/box";
import Button from "carbon-react/lib/components/button";

const App = (props) => {
  return (
    <CarbonProvider theme={sageTheme}>
      <GlobalStyle />
      <Box margin="0 25px">
        <Button>Hello Carbon</Button>
        <p>Please remember to select the appropriate version of Carbon.</p>
      </Box>
    </CarbonProvider>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("app"));
```
