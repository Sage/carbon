# Extending Styles of Carbon Components

There may be a rare use case where you need to extend the styles of a Carbon component. This can be done by creating a custom component using the `styled-components` library and extending the component you would like the additional styling applied to.

**We would always recommend this as a last resort as Carbon should already cater to a lot of your use cases**.

## Usage

Here we are using the `Box` component and applying styles that are not available in the `Box` component.
We would always recommend not using this method to manage z-indexes, as this can cause issues with the stacking order of components.
**This method is to be used as a last resort.**

```jsx
// import `styled` interface from the `styled-components` library.
import styled from "styled-components";
// import the component you would like to extend the styles of. In this case, we are using the `Box` component.
import Box from "carbon-react/lib/components/box";

// Creating the custom components for the additional styling to be applied to.
const CustomStyledBox = styled(Box)`
  z-index: 2;
  border: solid 2px red;
`;

const CustomStyledBoxBorders = styled(Box)`
  border-right: dotted 2px red;
  border-left: solid 3px red;
  border-top: dashed 2px black;
  border-bottom: solid 2px black;
`;

// Using the `CustomStyledBox` and `CustomStyledBoxBorders` alongside props that are currently available to the Box component.
return (
  <>
    <CustomStyledBox m={2} bg="aqua" height="250px" width="250px" />
    <CustomStyledBoxBorders m={2} bg="grey" height="250px" width="250px" />
  </>
);
```

Here is an example of the above code in action.
