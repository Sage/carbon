# 0.0.2.beta

## Decimal Component

 An extra validation has been added to decimal to prevent multiple separators from being entered in the input field.

## Dropdown and DropdownSuggest components

Dropdown and dropdown-suggest have been updated. As they share common functionality, dropdown and dropdown-suggest now use a List decorator. This should not affect how you use either component.

## Dialog Cancel button

Dialogs have been updated to pass context to any children components. We have used this to switch the Form Cancel button to use the Dialog's cancel handler when the form is nested in a dialog. This overrides the default history.back method.

## Store, View and Route Utils

We have standardised the utilities we provide to easily set up Flux based applications. This involved a few breaking changes:

### Store

The base Store class is now available from:

```js
import Store from 'carbon/lib/utils/flux/store';
```

When creating your store, initialize it with your application's dispatcher. You must also define the store's data and unique name within its constructor. The following shows the minimum required to set up a store:

```js
import Store from 'carbon/lib/utils/flux/store';
import Dispatcher from 'dispatcher';
import ImmutableHelper from 'carbon/lib/utils/helpers/immutable';

class MyStore extends Store {
  ...
}

let data = ImmutableHelper.parseJSON({});

// init the store with a name, some data, and your dispatcher
export default new MyStore('myStore', data, Dispatcher);
```

### View

The view helper is now available as a flux utility from Carbon. This was done to clarify its intentions. You can import it with:


```js
import { connect } from 'carbon/lib/utils/flux';
```

You can then use the `connect` function to connect a React component to a store:

```js
import React from 'react';
import MyStore from 'stores/my-store';
import { connect } from 'carbon/lib/utils/flux';

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // the connected store data is available on the state as the store's unique name defined in its constructor
    let val = this.state.myStore.get('myValue');

    return (
      <div>My Component.</div>
    );
  }
}

export default connect(MyComponent, MyStore);
```

This sets up the listeners and data synchronising between the component and the store.

The connect function can connect multiple stores to the component - simply provide them as an array:

```js
connect(MyComponent, [MyStore, MyOtherStore]);
```

### Route

The route helper now returns a specific function:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { Route } from 'react-router';
import { startRouter } from 'carbon/lib/utils/router';

let routes = (
  <Route />
);

startRouter(routes);
```

The `startRouter` function initializes the React router with the given routes. It can also take a second parameter for the HTML target in which to render the React components (by default this uses `document.getElementById('app')`).

## Higher Order Components and Decorators

We now use decorators instead of Higher Order Components in our component library as they are easier to test and result in a tidier and more logical codebase.

Decorators can be found in the `/utils/decorators` directory. So far we have decorators for:

* Input
* Input Icon
* Input Label
* Input Validation

Note: although there is an ES7 Babel transform for decorators, we have opted not to use it for now due to the way in which it compiles and produces missing coverage reports.

## TableFieldsForMany renamed

`TableFieldsForMany` is now called `InputGrid`.

We have renamed this because its original name was based on a Rails convention and was fairly obscure and confusing.

## New Brand
A new style and colour scheme has been applied to the carbon components library. This change will affect all of the components.

## Validations
Validations have changed to a function so that different parameters can be passed to them.

You can now define Validations on a component using the following syntax:

```javascript
<Textbox validations={ [Validation()] } name='valid' />
```

## Misc

* Ran ESLint task and fixed any errors.
* Form provides a serialization method to parse its inputs into data usable for AJAX.
* Forms no longer needs a model name defined.
* Updated Form Cancel Button to use History object.
* Textarea is no longer draggable. Add a expandable={true} prop to make the area height change to fit content
* Input components can now use custom classes.
* Checkbox label now sits inline, and is reversable.
* Added props on inputs for inline labels.
* Added Rainbow chart component.
* Decimal now allows tabbing in and out of the field.
* Date now closes on tab out.
