# Cypress Cucumber tests for Carbon storybook

## Getting started
1. Clone the carbon repository `git clone git@github.com:Sage/carbon.git`
2. Checkout cypress-cucumber-storybook branch `git checkout cypress-cucumber-storybook`
3. Install `npm install`
4. Run storybook `npm run storybook`
5. Open new terminal at the same path
6. Run cypress `npm run test-cypress`
7. If you would like to run specific cypress tests in command line (headless browser for continous integration) use: `npm run test-cypress --spec 'cypress/features/[tests-type]/[featureFileName].feature'`
8. We have 3 test suites:
  * Only build suite tests, which are running on Travis after every change/commit/push in repository. To run use:`npm run test-cypress-build`
  * Only accessibility suite tests, which are running on TeamCity nightly and verifying do the components have the accessibility vulnerabilities. To run use:`npm run test-cypress-accessibility`
  * Regression test suite, runs on TeamCity nightly and make all regression tests. To use run: `npm run test-cypress-regression`

## Coding standards
1. Use ESlint plugin to Visual Studio Code to make sure code format is preserved
2. Use kebab-case for all `*.js` file names
3. Use camelCase for `*.feature` file names
4. Use BDD keywords:
  * GIVEN - the given part describes the state of the world before you begin the behavior you are specifying in this scenario. You can think of it as the pre-conditions to the test
  * WHEN - the when section is that behavior that you are specifying. All action you need to perform before making an assertion
  * THEN - the then section describes the changes you expect due to the specified behavior. Regular assertion
  * AND - each of the section could have own and state. You can use and to avoid using duplication of the keywords (Given / When / Then)
  * Scenarion outline - tests that are using parameters from given Examples under the test and will run as much as there are examples
  * Scenario - tests that are run once
5. Step definitions for BDD:
  * Step definitions are created per component as `component-steps.js`. And should be used in exactly `component.feature`
  * Common steps (`common-steps.js`) are used to use steps written inside for all common actions
6. Common test steps:
  * I set `<knobs field>` to `<parameter>`
  * I select `<knobs field>` to `<parameter>`
  * I check / uncheck `<knobs filed>` checkbox
  * I open `<name>` component page
    * To open different stories on storybook
      * I open `<name>` component page `classic` / `basic` / `with button` / `legacy spinner` / `iframe` / `with button page in iframe` / `multiple` /`validations`

## Scenario tags
Use scenario tags:
1. `@positive` for happy path
2. `@negative` for negative scenario
3. `@ignore` for temporary ignored scenarios
4. `@[bug-number]` for example `@FE-1234` - use this tag after `@ignore` to explain why test is ignored
5. `@ignore` and `@[bug-number]` should be removed after bug fix
6. `@build` for pipeline - each build is verified by those tests
7. `@accessibility` tests verifies accessibility violations
8. `@validations` tests verify validation components
9. `@deprecated` tests verifies deprecated components

## Locators
### How to locate elements
Always use unique selectors to locate elements with order below:
1. `[data-component="unique-tag"]` for component and `[data-element="unique-tag"]` for component's element
2. `#id`
3. `.class-name`

### How to use locators
1. Locators are used, the same as step-definitions, per component
2. Common locators should be used when the components / elements are common for all stories
3. Locators should be named:
  * Component on preview - `componentPreview`
  * Knobs - `componentKnobs`

## Continuous Integration (CI)
### Travis
Every commit / pull request in repository initializing cypress `@build` tests and runs:
1. `npm run storybook-ci </dev/null &>/dev/null &` - runs storybook
2. `npm run lint ./src && npm test -- --maxWorkers=2` - runs lint test and after that runs jest tests
3. `npm run test-storybook-smoke` - runs `--smoke-test` and `--ci` - exit after successful start and don't open the browser
4. `wait-on http://localhost:9001` - waits until storybook is up and running and is ready to run tests
5. `npm run test-cypress-build` - run `@build` tests suite
