/*
 * styled-system/color allows users to use a color from the theme, from the `colors` object.
 *
 * The DLS defines colors in shades or tints rather than explicitly listing all possible colours
 * e.g. goldTint10, brilliantGreenShade55
 *
 * In our palette we have methods to access these colors
 * e.g. palette.goldTint(10)
 *
 * We could use a proxy to make those calls directly on the theme however styled-components expects the theme to be a
 * plain object and does not allow us to merge a theme from a ThemeProvider with a theme defined as a defaultProp if
 * both of those have a Proxy.
 * e.g. when the mint theme in the ThemeProvider is merged with the base theme in the defaultProps
 *
 * The purpose of this function is to intercept any palette colors, we only want styled-system to deal with CSS strings
 * and theme.colors.
 *
 * This allows us to keep our themes as plain objects.
