# useCharacterCount

`useCharacterCount` is a custom React hook that provides a character counter for text based input fields, and can be used in place of the `characterLimit` prop.

The hook returns an array containing a JSX element and an ID as a string. The JSX element displays a visual character counter alongside a visually hidden hint that
provides additional context to screen reader users. 

To associate the character counter with the corresponding input field please ensure you pass the returned ID to the input's `aria-describedby` attribute. 
This hook also implements a debounce function to ensure screen reader announcements occur after a brief delay after the user stops typing, rather than on every keypress.

**Note:** This hook is currently not supported on the `TextEditor` component as this component uses its own custom character counter plugin.
