## Examples

### Default

<Canvas of={DialogFullScreenStories.Default} />

### With complex example

If you want to use more than one group of `Tabs` remember to put `selectedTabId` prop in every `Tabs` component
to have a possibility to manage active `Tabs` group

### With disableContentPadding

<Canvas of={DialogFullScreenStories.WithDisableContentPadding} />

### With header children

<Canvas of={DialogFullScreenStories.WithHeaderChildren} />

### With help

<Canvas of={DialogFullScreenStories.WithHelp} />

### With hideable header children

<Canvas of={DialogFullScreenStories.WithHideableHeaderChildren} />

### With `Box`

### Overriding the first focused element

By default, when a dialog is opened it will automatically focus the first element within its children that can be focussed.
However, there are a couple of ways of overriding this default behaviour. The `focusFirstElement` prop accepts a reference
to the element you wish to focus on open (an example of this can be seen by clicking the first button below). If the element
you want to focus supports `autoFocus` then the you can override the default behaviour by using the `disableAutoFocus` prop
and setting the `autoFocus` on the element you wish to be focused instead (click the second button to see an example).

<Canvas of={DialogFullScreenStories.FocusingADifferentFirstElement} />

### Allowing other elements to be focused

Using the `focusableContainers` prop allows elements that are not DOM children of the Dialog to be reachable with the keyboard while the Dialog is open.
This may occasionally be useful with things like Toasts where they persist on the page until dismissed by clicking a close icon.

### Top modal override

When multiple modals are open on a page Carbon manages the order internally so that the last one mounted in the DOM
is treated as the top one and the focus trap is set on it. However, this can potentially
create unexpected issues if the loading of the dialogs isn't synchronous. In order to guarantee that a given
modal is treated as top set the `topModalOverride` prop. Please note that in the scenario where this prop is
set on multiple modals, the last one mounted with it will be treated as top.

## Translation keys

The following keys are available to override the translations for this component by passing in a custom locale object to the
[i18nProvider](../?path=/docs/documentation-i18n--docs).

<TranslationKeysTable
  translationData={[
    {
      name: "dialogFullScreen.ariaLabels.close",
      description: "The text for close button aria-label attribute",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
  ]}
/>
