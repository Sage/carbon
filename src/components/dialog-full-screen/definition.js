  designerNotes: `
* Useful to perform an action in context without navigating the user to a separate page.
* Whilst a standard Dialog componentâ€™s width might constrain what you can do, the full screen dialog uses the full width
 and height available.
* A good example could be importing a large volume of data, and checking for errors, in the context of an underlying
 Table of data.
  `,
  relatedComponentsNotes: `
* Simple task in context? [Try Dialog](/components/dialog).
* Need to refer back to the underlying page? [Try Sidebar](/components/sidebar).
