## Examples

### Default

<Canvas>
  <Story name="default" story={stories.Default} />
</Canvas>

### With complex example

If you want to use more than one group of `Tabs` remember to put `selectedTabId` prop in every `Tabs` component
to have a possibility to manage active `Tabs` group

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with complex example" story={stories.WithComplexExample} />
</Canvas>

### With disableContentPadding

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="with disableContentPadding"
    story={stories.WithDisableContentPadding}
  />
</Canvas>

### With header children

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with header children" story={stories.WithHeaderChildren} />
</Canvas>

### With help

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with help" story={stories.WithHelp} />
</Canvas>

### With hideable header children

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="with hideable header children"
    story={stories.WithHideableHeaderChildren}
  />
</Canvas>

### With `Box`

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with box" story={stories.WithBox} />
</Canvas>

### Overriding the first focused element

By default, when a dialog is opened it will automatically focus the first element within its children that can be focussed.
However, there are a couple of ways of overriding this default behaviour. The `focusFirstElement` prop accepts a reference
to the element you wish to focus on open (an example of this can be seen by clicking the first button below). If the element
you want to focus supports `autoFocus` then the you can override the default behaviour by using the `disableAutoFocus` prop
and setting the `autoFocus` on the element you wish to be focused instead (click the second button to see an example).

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="focusing a different first element"
    story={stories.FocusingADifferentFirstElement}
  />
</Canvas>

### Allowing other elements to be focused

Using the `focusableContainers` prop allows elements that are not DOM children of the Dialog to be reachable with the keyboard while the Dialog is open.
This may occasionally be useful with things like Toasts where they persist on the page until dismissed by clicking a close icon.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="other focusable containers"
    story={stories.OtherFocusableContainers}
  />
</Canvas>

## Props

### DialogFullScreen

<ArgsTable of={DialogFullScreen} />

## Translation keys

The following keys are available to override the translations for this component by passing in a custom locale object to the
[i18nProvider](https://carbon.sage.com/?path=/story/documentation-i18n--page).

<TranslationKeysTable
  translationData={[
    {
      name: "dialogFullScreen.ariaLabels.close",
      description: "The text for close button aria-label attribute",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
  ]}
/>
