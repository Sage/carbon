# TileSelect

Tile Select is an input visualized as a single or grouped set of tiles. It behaves like a `radio` or a `checkbox` depending on the mode it operates in.

## Quick Start

To use this component, import the `TileSelect` and `TileSelectGroup` if you want to have `TileSelects` grouped.

```javascript
import {
  TileSelectGroup,
  TileSelect,
} from "carbon-react/lib/components/tile-select";
```

## Examples

### Single Select

By default, when grouped with the `TileSelectGroup`, this component operates in single select mode and `TileSelect` inputs are of type `radio`.

In this mode all input props like `onChange`, `onBlur`, `name` and currently selected `value` are meant to be passed on the `TileSelectGroup`.
These props are then internally distributed on each of the `TileSelects` making the whole composed group act like a single form field.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="default" story={stories.Default} />
</Canvas>

#### Custom action button

It is possible to overide the default action button via the `customActionButton` prop. It is a render prop which allows
access to the `onClick` functionality.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="with custom action button"
    story={stories.WithCustomActionButton}
  />
</Canvas>

#### Action button adornment

It is possible to render an additional adornment next to the action button through the `actionButtonAdornment` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="with action button adornment"
    story={stories.WithActionButtonAdornment}
  />
</Canvas>

### Multi select

To enable multi select mode on a `TileSelectGroup` `multiSelect` boolean prop has to be passed as `true`, `TileSelects` in this mode are of type `checkbox`.

In multi select mode all input props like `onChange`, `onBlur`, `name`, `value` and `checked` are meant to be passed individually on each of the `TileSelects` instead of on the `TileSelectGroup`.

In this mode `TileSelectGroup` serves only a visual purpose - it only renders `legend` and `description` props and applies spacing to each of the `TileSelects`

<Canvas>
  <Story name="multi Select" story={stories.MultiSelect} />
</Canvas>

### Single tile

`TileSelect` can be also used as a single component - it operates as a type `checkbox` by default.

Same as in multi select example grouped by `TileSelectGroup`, `onChange`, `onBlur`, `name`, `value` and `checked` are meant to be passed directly on the `TileSelect`.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="single tile" story={stories.SingleTile} />
</Canvas>

### With a footer

To render a `footer` pass anything renderable to the prop like in the example below.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with a footer" story={stories.WithAFooter} />
</Canvas>

### With a prefix adornment

To render a prefixed adornment in the top left corner of the `TileSelect` you can pass any node in via the `prefixAdornment` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with a prefix adornment" story={stories.WithAPrefixAdornment} />
</Canvas>

### With additional information

It is possible to render an additional row of information or content between the `title` and the `description` by passing in
any node to the `additionalInformation` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="with additional information"
    story={stories.WithAdditionalInformation}
  />
</Canvas>

### With accordion footer

It is possible to render an `Accordion` footer for the `TileSelect`. Pass a desired layout to the `accordionContent` prop
and a use the `accordionControl` render prop to supply the control for the expanded state of the accordion by toggling the
`accordionExpanded` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with accordion footer" story={stories.WithAccordionFooter} />
</Canvas>

### With custom spacing

The `TileSelect` and `TileSelectGroup` components support the custom margin spacing (see prop table below). The modifiers
support being passed either a number between 1 and 8 that is then multiplied by `8px` or any valid CSS string.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with custom spacing" story={stories.WithCustomSpacing} />
</Canvas>

## Props

### TileSelect

<StyledSystemProps of={TileSelect} margin noHeader />

### TileSelectGroup

<StyledSystemProps of={TileSelectGroup} margin noHeader />

## Translation keys

The following keys are available to override the translations for this component by passing in a custom locale object to the
[i18nProvider](https://carbon.sage.com/?path=/story/documentation-i18n--page).

<TranslationKeysTable
  translationData={[
    {
      name: "tileSelect.deselect",
      description: "The text for the deselect button component",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
  ]}
/>
