## Quick Start

```javascript
import Typography, {
  List,
  ListItem,
} from "carbon-react/lib/components/typography";
```

## Variants

Use the `variant` prop to control the visual style, this will also change the element that is rendered. If you wish to
use a different element you can use the `as` prop.

It's possible to change the text colour and background, using the color props. See [Colors](../?path=/docs/documentation-colors--docs) for more information.

It's possible to change the text position, using the spacing props. See the prop tables below for more information.

It's also possible to create ordered and unordered lists using the `List`, `ListItem` helpers. These components are syntactic sugar around the `Typography` component and accept the same props.

## Example of truncate

The `truncate` prop is a boolean prop that automatically applies  `overflow: hidden` and `white-space: nowrap`, which are the styles required to truncate a piece of text.

By default, this prop will truncate the text with an ellipsis, but you can also pass the `textOverflow` prop to override this behaviour. 

This prop will only work with block level elements, so ensure `display="block"` or similar is set to enable this functionality.
