# Typography

<DeprecationWarning>
  This version of the `Typography` component and its sub-components (`List`, `ListItem`) are no longer supported and will be removed
  in a future release. Please consider moving to the{" "}
  <a style={{ color: "white" }} href="../?path=/docs/typography--docs">
    {" "}
    newer implementation
  </a>{" "}
  as soon as possible.

  For lists, use proper semantic HTML elements with the new Typography component:
  ```tsx
  <ul>
    <li><Typography>Item 1</Typography></li>
    <li><Typography>Item 2</Typography></li>
  </ul>
  ```

## Quick Start

```javascript
import Typography, {
  List,
  ListItem,
} from "carbon-react/lib/components/typography";
```

## Variants

Use the `variant` prop to control the visual style, this will also change the element that is rendered. If you wish to
use a different element you can use the `as` prop.

It's possible to change the text colour and background, using the color props. See [Colors](../?path=/docs/documentation-colors--docs) for more information.

It's possible to change the text position, using the spacing props. See the prop tables below for more information.

## Lists

Use `List` and `ListItem` to create ordered and unordered lists. These components are syntactic sugar around the `Typography` component and accept the same props.
By default, `List` will render an unordered list, but you can pass `ol` to the `variant` prop to render an ordered list; all other typography variants will render
the `ListItem` component as an unordered list (examples of which are shown in [ListItem Inheritance](#listitem-inheritance)).

<Canvas of={TypographyStories.Lists} />

## ListItem Inheritance

When using `List` and `ListItem`, set the `variant` on the `List` component to apply the same variant to all `ListItem` components within it.

## Example of truncate

The `truncate` prop is a boolean prop that automatically applies  `overflow: hidden` and `white-space: nowrap`, which are the styles required to truncate a piece of text.

By default, this prop will truncate the text with an ellipsis, but you can also pass the `textOverflow` prop to override this behaviour.

This prop will only work with block level elements, so ensure `display="block"` or similar is set to enable this functionality.
