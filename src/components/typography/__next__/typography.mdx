## Quick Start

```javascript
import Typography from "carbon-react/lib/components/typography/__next__/";
```

## Designer Notes

- The Typography component provides a consistent and flexible system for managing text styles across your design. 
- It includes multiple heading and body text options to accommodate various content hierarchies.
- With theme support for large screens and small screens, this helps ensure readability and brand alignment across different contexts. 

## Examples

### Variants

Use the `variant` prop to render an element and creates a visual style associated with said element. The `as` prop can also be 
used to override the underlying HTML element.

## Fluid

When set to `true`, the component uses fluid typography with CSS clamp() values for responsive sizing. 
This allows the text to scale smoothly between breakpoints without requiring media queries.

## Inverse

When set to `true`, inverts the font colour for use on darker backgrounds. 
This ensures sufficient contrast and readability when the Typography component is placed over dark container backgrounds.

## Size

The `size` prop controls the font size applied to paragraph text. 
Only available when `variant` is set to `"p"`. Choose between `"regular"` for standard text and `"large"` for emphasis.

## Tint

The `tint` prop applies a colour tint to paragraph text. 
Only available when `variant` is set to `"p"`. Use `"default"` for standard text colour or `"alt"` for alternative text colour.

## Weight

The `weight` prop controls the font weight applied to paragraph text. 
Only available when `variant` is set to `"p"`. Choose between `"regular"` for normal weight or `"medium"` for heavier emphasis.
