# Pod

Presents content grouped visually together. This can be text, or other components. A good example is a ‘tile’ showing contact information for an individual.

## Quick Start

```javascript
import Pod from "carbon-react/lib/components/pod";
```

## Designer Notes

Configure Pod and Fieldset components to work together, or choose the pre-configured Show/Edit Pod component:

The ShowEditPod component automatically presents content as a read-only Pod, until the user clicks an edit icon, which shows the same information in an editable Fieldset.

However, configuring Pod and Fieldset components manually will give you more customization options, like the following:

The onEdit property shows a standard edit icon, which can be used to show a fieldset. You can choose whether this icon appears inside or outside the pod, and whether it appears only on hover. You can also choose whether clicking only the icon triggers the onEdit property, or clicking anywhere on the pod.

Choose from various visual options, including padding, borders, and primary, secondary, or tertiary appearance.

Set the pod to flex to the width of its content, or take up the full width of its container.

## Examples

### Default

<Preview>
  <Story name="default">
    <Pod title="Title">Content</Pod>
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Collapsable

Pod accepts collapsed prop which sets the intial state of the Pod and allows it
to be collapsible. If the prop is not passed the Pod will not be collapsible.

<Preview>
  <Story name="collapsable">
    <Pod title="Title" collapsed>
      Content
    </Pod>
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Custom height

<Preview>
  <Story name="with custom height">
    <Pod
      title="Title"
      subtitle="Subtitle"
      description="Description"
      footer="Footer"
      height={350}
    >
      Content
    </Pod>
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Even height

If you want to have the same height of the Pods based on the highest one, use `Grid` component to position `Pods`
and then set `height` prop to `100%` on each `Pod` so that it fills the entire height of `GridItem`
