# Pod

Presents content grouped visually together. This can be text, or other components. A good example is a ‘tile’ showing contact information for an individual.

## Quick Start

```javascript
import Pod from "carbon-react/lib/components/pod";
```

## Designer's Notes

- Configure Pod and Fieldset components manually to customise the following:

- The onEdit property shows a standard edit icon, which can be used to show a fieldset. You can choose whether this icon appears inside or outside the pod, and whether it appears only on hover. You can also choose whether clicking only the icon triggers the onEdit property, or clicking anywhere on the pod.

- Choose from various visual options, including padding, borders, and primary, secondary, or tertiary appearance.

- Set the pod to flex to the width of its content, or take up the full width of its container.

## Examples

### Default

<Canvas of={PodStories.Default} />

### with title and subtitle passed as nodes

A node can be passed as both the `title` and `subtitle` props, we recommend using `<Typography>`

<Canvas of={PodStories.WithTitleAndSubtitleNode} />

### Custom height

<Canvas of={PodStories.WithCustomHeight} />

### Even height

If you want to have the same height of the Pods based on the highest one, use `Grid` component to position `Pods`
and then set `height` prop to `100%` on each `Pod` so that it fills the entire height of `GridItem`

<Canvas of={PodStories.EvenHeightMultiplePods} />

## Translation keys

The following keys are available to override the translations for this component by passing in a custom locale object to the
[i18nProvider](../?path=/docs/documentation-i18n--docs).

<TranslationKeysTable
  translationData={[
    {
      name: "actions.edit",
      description: "The text for edit button",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
    {
      name: "actions.delete",
      description: "The text for delete button",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
