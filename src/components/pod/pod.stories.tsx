          text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of
          type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived

          typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in

          passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
          Aldus PageMa ker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
