## Quick Start

To create fully functioning `Duelling Picklist` component you can compose it yourself out of provided `Carbon` components.

```javascript
import {
  Picklist,
  PicklistItem,
  PicklistDivider,
  PicklistPlaceholder,
  DuellingPicklist,
} from "carbon-react/lib/components/duelling-picklist";
```

- `DuellingPicklist` is meant to be a container composed of two `Picklist` children and a `PicklistDivider` between them.

- It also accepts `leftLabel` and `rightLabel` props of type string which will be rendered above the corresponding `PickList`.

- Similarly to labels, `leftControls` and `rightControls` props accept a node to be rendered between the labels and the `Picklist`.
  This is a suitable place for components like `Search` or `Filter` used to manipulate displayed data.
  To display an overlay over whole `DuellingPicklist` content pass a `disabled` prop set to true.

- `Picklist` wraps a list of `PicklistItem`, applies enter transition animations and provides an extended keyboard navigation (up/down/home/end keys).

- `PicklistDivider` as name states is a component meant to visually divide two `PickList`. It is optional, the spacing between the two picklists will be equal with or without it.

- `PicklistItem` is a component meant to visually represent one of the iterable entities. It can be of a type `add` or `remove`.
  It invokes passed `onChange` method with passed `item` prop as an argument when either `add` or `remove` icon is clicked or `space` or `enter` pressed when whole `PicklistItem` is focused.

- `PicklistPlaceholder` can be used to display the content of its `text` prop. It is meant to be passed as a `placeholder` prop in `Picklist` component.

## Examples

### Default

Example of composed Duelling Picklist components with order preservation and search implemented.

<Canvas of={DuellingPicklistStories.Default} />

### Alternative search placement

The `Search` component can be placed outside of the picklist controls and positioned anywhere as required. This example also shows the option of not using a `PicklistDivider`.

<Canvas
  name="alternative search placement"
  of={DuellingPicklistStories.AlternativeSearch}
/>

### Grouped

Picklist items can be organised into selectable groups. Whole groups can be moved from one list to another at once, or group items can be moved individually.

<Canvas of={DuellingPicklistStories.Grouped} />

### In Dialog

Same as above but as a children of `Dialog` component.

<Canvas of={DuellingPicklistStories.InDialog} />
