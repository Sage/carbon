  designerNotes: `
* Various colours and sizes are available - the colours match the states for Messages, Toasts, and other components.
* Created with HTML and CSS rather than an animated graphic, which allows for easier customisation.
* If the spinner is likely to appear for a long time, consider placing some dynamic messaging on-screen to reassure the user that something is in progress, and they shouldn’t re-load the page manually.
* Carbon doesn’t feature a progress bar, as it’s often difficult to accurately calculate when many processes will complete, and many are relatively fast.
