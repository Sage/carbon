## Quick Start

```javascript
import Pill from "carbon-react/lib/components/pill";
```

## Examples

### Default

<Canvas of={PillStories.Default} />

### Wrapped

By default the text within a Pill will not wrap. You can override this behavior by setting the `wrapText`
and `maxWidth` props. It is also possible to hyphenate the words but you may need to define where to place
the hyphens using `&shy;` if they are not automatically added: this is because the rules for adding them are
language-specific and support for every `lang` attrribute is not universal.

### With remove button

When a callback in the onDelete prop is provided, a remove button will be rendered
and click on it will trigger that callback.

<Canvas of={PillStories.WithRemoveButton} />

### With custom remove button aria-label

By default the aria-label of the remove button will be set to "remove pill".
That attribute could be customized to increase accessibility by providing unique button descriptions
in the `ariaLabelOfRemoveButton` prop.

### Status Pills

An automatic indicator of status, styled with utility colours to carry meaning.

<Canvas of={PillStories.Status} />

### Tag Pills

Applied by the user, and indicate something in common. Change the theme to see the available colours.

<Canvas of={PillStories.Tag} />

### Custom colors

It's possible to change the color of the Pill by using the `borderColor` prop. It will override `colorVariant` value.
See [Colors](../?path=/docs/documentation-colors--docs) for more information.

<Canvas of={PillStories.CustomColors} />

### Dark background

Color variants for dark theme, to apply these set `isDarkBackground` to `true`.
Note: `"neutralWhite"` can only be used on dark backgrounds with `fill` also set to true.
