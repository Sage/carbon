# Designer Notes
- A standard page or section header, with a range of options, such as a help link presented as an icon, a sub-heading, a 'Back' icon, and visual dividers and separators.
- Make sure that the colour of all text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5.1, to meet the [WCAG 2.0 AA standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html "WCAG 2.0 AA standard") for text less than 19px in size. Webaim have a good online Contrast Checker.
