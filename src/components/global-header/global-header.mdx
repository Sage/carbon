## Quick Start

```javascript
import GlobalHeader from "carbon-react/lib/components/global-header";
```

## Examples

### Default

`GlobalHeader` shares similarities with the [NavigationBar component](../?path=/docs/navigation-bar--docs), but is permanently fixed to the top of the viewport and has a greater z-index than `NavigationBar`.

<Canvas of={GlobalHeaderStories.Default} />

### With logo

A custom logo in the form of an HTML element or a React component can be rendered by passing it via the `logo` prop. The logo is wrapped in a container that applies style rules for margins and child element height. It is possible to set a custom height for the logo element, but any value that exceeds the height of the `GlobalHeader` component will be constrained to 40px.

### Basic menu

In conjunction with the [Menu component](../?path=/docs/menu--docs), `GlobalHeader` can be used to create global navigation layouts.

<Canvas of={GlobalHeaderStories.BasicMenu} />

### Responsive menu

This story is best viewed in the `canvas` view and by adjusting the size of the window. The fullscreen behaviour will trigger when the screen size is smaller than `600px`.

<Canvas of={GlobalHeaderStories.ResponsiveMenu} />

### Global and local navigation bar layout

The component can be used alongside the [NavigationBar component](../?path=/docs/navigation-bar--docs) to create a two navigation bar layout, with the former being for site-wide navigation and the latter being for local navigation. Since `GlobalHeader` is fixed to top of the viewport, the `NavigationBar` must also have its `position` fixed, with a top `orientation` and `offset` of 40px.
