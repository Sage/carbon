### Default - Light variant

<Preview>
  <Story name="light variant">
    <Box p={2}>
      <DismissibleBox onClose={(e) => action("onClose")(e)}>
        <Box display="flex">
          <Typography mb={0}>
            Well, that's certainly good to know. Your head is not an artifact! Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly 
            as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? 
            Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Travel time to the nearest starbase? I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. 
            You enjoyed that. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked 
            with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Well, that's certainly good to know. 
            Your head is not an artifact! Rrrrred alert! Rrrrred alert! Rrrrred alert!
          </Typography>
          <VerticalDivider p={0} px={2} />
          <Image

### With no left border highlight

By default the component will be rendered with a thicker left border highlight, use the `hasBorderLeftHighlight` to opt-out 
of this functionality.

<Preview>
  <Story name="with no left border highlight">
    <Box p={2}>
      <DismissibleBox mb={2} hasBorderLeftHighlight={false} onClose={(e) => action("onClose")(e)}>
        <Box display="flex">
          <Typography mb={0}>

            src={require("../../../.assets/point.svg")}
            width="120px"
          />
        </Box>
      </DismissibleBox>
    </Box>

### Width overridden

It is also possible to override the `width` of the component: by default it will fill any available space.

<Preview>
  <Story name="width overridden">
    <Box p={2}>
      <DismissibleBox width="650px" onClose={(e) => action("onClose")(e)}>
         <Box display="flex">
          <Typography mb={0}>
