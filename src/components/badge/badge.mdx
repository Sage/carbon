## Quick Start

To use Badge component you need to import `Badge` and use another component as a child.

```javascript
import Badge from "carbon-react/lib/components/badge";
```

## Examples

### Default Badge

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Default} />

### Badge with counter > 99

Badge doesn't support more than 2 digits

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.WithThreeDigits} />

### Badge with counter 0

If the counter is less than 1 badge will not show itself

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.WithCounterZero} />

### Display Only

To achieve a `display only` version of this component, you can simply not pass an `onClick` function to the component. This means that instead of rendering as a `button` element,
the component will render as a `span`.

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.DisplayOnly} />

### Custom Color

You can use the `color` prop to override the default color of the component.

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.CustomColor} />

## Props

### Badge

<ArgTypes of={BadgeStories} />
