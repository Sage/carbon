## Quick Start

To use Badge component, import `Badge` and use as a standalone component or wrap it around another component to position it relatively.

```javascript
import Badge from "carbon-react/lib/components/badge";
```

## Examples

### Default

To render a `Badge`, pass the `counter` prop with a number or string value.

If the value is a number greater than `999`, it will be displayed as `999+`.
If the value is a string, the displayed value will be limited to 4 characters, therefore please ensure to format the string accordingly.

If the `counter` prop is not provided or its value is `0`, the `Badge` will not render.

### With Children

To position a `Badge` relative to another component, for example a `Button`, you can pass it as a child of `Badge`.

Please make sure you associate the `Badge` to the component it relates to, this can be done by setting the `Badge`'s `id` to the child component's `aria-describedby`.

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.WithChildren} />

### Sizes

You can use the `size` prop to change the size of the `Badge` to "small", "medium" (default), or "large".

The "small" size will not visually display the `counter` value, however the prop will still be needed for the badge to render.

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Sizes} />

### Subtle Variant

By default, the `Badge` is rendered as the "typical" variant, however you can use the `variant` prop to change the appearance to "subtle".

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.SubtleVariant} />

### Inverse

You can use the `inverse` prop to render the `Badge` with the inverse color scheme.

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Inverse} />

### (Deprecated) Badge with onClick

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.WithOnClick} />

### (Deprecated) Custom Color

You can use the `color` prop to override the default color of the component.

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.CustomColor} />
