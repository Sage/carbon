## Quick Start

To use Badge component you need to import `Badge` and use another component as a child.

```javascript
import Badge from "carbon-react/lib/components/badge";
```

## Examples

### Default Badge

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Default} />

### Badge with counter > 99

If the `counter` value greater than 2 digits, the displayed value will be truncated to "99".

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.WithThreeDigits} />

### Badge with counter 0

If the `counter` value is `0`, the badge will not be displayed.

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.WithCounterZero} />

### Display Only

By not providing an `onClick` prop, the badge will be rendered as a display-only element. 
To ensure they are accessible to screen readers, you can pass the `Badge`'s `id` to the `aria-describedby` prop of the element that it is describing.

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.DisplayOnly} />

### Custom Color

You can use the `color` prop to override the default color of the component.

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.CustomColor} />

## Props

### Badge

<ArgTypes of={BadgeStories} />
