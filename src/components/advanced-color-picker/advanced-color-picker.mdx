## Quick Start

To use advanced color picker, import `AdvancedColorPicker`

```javascript
import AdvancedColorPicker from "carbon-react/lib/components/advanced-color-picker";
```

## Examples

### Basic usage

Shows how the color picker can be used to select a color from a predefined set.

<Canvas of={AdvancedColorPickerStories.Default} />

### Preventing focus from being restored when AdvancedColorPicker closes

When the `restoreFocusOnClose` prop is `false`, focus will not be restored to the element that was focused before the `AdvancedColorPicker` was opened.
Focus can instead be programmatically applied to another element if appropriate. 

<Canvas of={AdvancedColorPickerStories.RestoreFocusOnCloseStory} />

## Props

### AdvancedColorPicker

<ArgTypes of={AdvancedColorPickerStories} />
