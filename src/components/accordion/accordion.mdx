Accordions are a good progressive disclosure technique - initially showing only top-level information, but allowing the user quick access to more on request. They should be used sparingly, as some users (e.g. those with low digital literacy) may find them confusing.

## Quick Start

To use accordions, import the `Accordion` component and pass the desired content as child components.

```javascript
import {
  Accordion,
} from "carbon-react/lib/components/accordion";

const MyComponent = () => (
    <Accordion title="Title">
      <p>Content as children</p>
    </Accordion>

);
```

To group accordions together, use the native `div` element or import the `Box` component and wrap your `Accordion` components with it.

```javascript
import {
  Accordion,
} from "carbon-react/lib/components/accordion";

const MyComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <Accordion title="Title">
      <p>Content as children</p>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Title">
      <p>Content as children</p>
    </Accordion>
  </div>
);
```

## Examples

### Default

By default, the accordion is closed, has a white background and no side borders.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.DefaultAccordion} />

### Expanded by Default

Set the `expanded` prop to `true` to have the accordion open by default.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.ExpandedByDefault} />

### Left-aligned Icon

You can move the indicator icon to the left by setting the `iconPosition` prop to `left`.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.LeftAlignedIcon} />

### Right-aligned Icon

By default, the indicator icon will be positioned on the right.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.RightAlignedIcon} />

### Open Title

You can set a title to be shown when the component is open by setting the `openTitle` prop as a string.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.OpenTitle} />

### Custom Title Node

You can pass a custom node as the title by setting the `title` prop to a React node.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.CustomTitleNode} />

### Subtle

You can set the `subtle` prop to `true` to have a more subtle appearance styling.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Subtle} />

### With Error

Pass a string to the `error` prop to show an error message.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.WithError} />

### With Warning

Pass a string to the `warning` prop to show a warning message.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.WithWarning} />

### With Info

Pass a string to the `info` prop to show an info message.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.WithInfo} />

### Disabled Content Padding

Set the `disableContentPadding` prop to `true` to remove the padding from the content.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.DisabledContentPadding} />

### With Subtitle

Pass a string to the `subtitle` prop to show a subtitle.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.WithSubtitle} />

### Icon Variant

You can change the icon variant by setting the `iconVariant` prop to `chevron_down`, `chevron_down_thick` or `dropdown`.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.IconVariant} />

### Full Borders

Set the `borders` prop to `full` to have borders on all sides.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.FullBorders} />

### No Borders

Set the `borders` prop to `none` to remove borders on all sides.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.NoBorders} />

### Small Size

Set the `size` prop to `small` to have a smaller accordion.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.SmallSize} />

### Header Spacing

Set the `headerSpacing` prop to adjust or remove the spacing around the header.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.HeaderSpacing} />

### Custom Change Handler

You can pass a custom change handler to the `onChange` prop.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.CustomChangeHandler} />

### Custom Width

You can set a custom width by passing a string to the `width` prop.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.CustomWidth} />

### Group Semantically

Accordions can now be semantically grouped using the `groupName` prop. Using this approach, only one accordion can be open in a group at any given time.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.GroupedSemantically} />
