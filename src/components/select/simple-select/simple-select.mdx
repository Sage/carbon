Select one of available options from the drop-down menu. Simple Select is a Carbon styled equivalent of HTML Select Element.

## Quick Start

To use the `Select` component you have to import two components: `<Select />` and `<Option />`
from `carbon-react/lib/components/select`.

```javascript
import { Select, Option } from "carbon-react/lib/components/select";
```

Always insert `Option` Components inside the `Select`, analogous to the original `<select>` and `<option>` HTML Elements.

## Examples

### Default

<Canvas of={SimpleSelectStories.Default} />

### Required

You can use the `required` prop to indicate if the field is mandatory.

<Canvas of={SimpleSelectStories.Required} />

### Optional

You can use the `isOptional` prop to indicate if the field is mandatory.

<Canvas of={SimpleSelectStories.IsOptional} />

### List placement

You can use `listPlacement` prop to set the position of the select list relative to the input element.

<Canvas of={SimpleSelectStories.ListPlacement} />

### List height

You can use `listMaxHeight` prop to override default max height value of select list.

<Canvas of={SimpleSelectStories.ListHeight} />

### List width

You can use `listWidth` prop to override the width of the select list. By default the list
will have the same width as the input.

<Canvas
  name="list width"
  of={SimpleSelectStories.ListWidth}
/>

### Controlled usage

<Canvas of={SimpleSelectStories.Controlled} />

### With object as value

Option values could be passed as objects, useful when custom data is associated with an option.
When the `id` property is set, objects will be compared based on that property (could be used when the list is recreated after an API call).
If there is no `id` prop specified on an object, then the exact objects will be compared.

<Canvas of={SimpleSelectStories.WithObjectAsValue} />

### With custom maxWidth

In this example the `maxWidth` prop is 100%.

<Canvas of={SimpleSelectStories.WithCustomMaxWidth} />

### With isLoading prop

When `isLoading` prop is passed, a loader will be appended at the end of the Select List. That functionality could be used to load the options asynchronously.

<Canvas of={SimpleSelectStories.WithIsLoadingProp} />

### Infinite scroll example

The `isLoading` prop in combination with the `onListScrollBottom` prop can be used to implement infinite scroll.
This prop will be called every time a user scrolls to the bottom of the list.

<Canvas of={SimpleSelectStories.WithInfiniteScroll} />

### Open on focus

<Canvas of={SimpleSelectStories.OpenOnFocus} />

### Disabled

<Canvas of={SimpleSelectStories.Disabled} />

### Read Only

<Canvas of={SimpleSelectStories.Readonly} />

### Transparent

<Canvas of={SimpleSelectStories.Transparent} />

### Custom Option content

It is also possible to render non-interactive content within the `Option` component.
This can be achieved by passing `children` with no `value` or `text` props set. However,
we recommend checking that there are no accessibility issues with this approach before using it.

<Canvas of={SimpleSelectStories.CustomOptionChildren} />

### With multiple columns

<Canvas of={SimpleSelectStories.WithMultipleColumns} />

### Option groups

<Canvas of={SimpleSelectStories.OptionGroups} />

It is also possible to use the `children` prop to pass a composed layout to the
`OptionGroupHeader`. It should be noted it will override any values passed to the
`icon` and `label` props.

<Canvas of={SimpleSelectStories.OptionGroupsWithComposedChildren} />

### Enabling the adaptive behaviour

The inline label can change to be top aligned at a breakpoint. Enable this by passing in a number to the `adaptiveLabelBreakpoint` prop. This corresponds to a px screen width

<Canvas of={SimpleSelectStories.EnablingAdaptiveBehaviour} />

### New Validation Designs

The folowing examples use the new validation pattern that is available by setting the `validationRedesignOptIn` flag on the `CarbonProvider` to true.

For more information check our [Validations](../?path=/docs/documentation-validations--docs) documentation page.

**Note:** The `labelInline` prop is not supported if the `validationRedesignOptIn` flag on the `CarbonProvider` is true.

<Canvas of={SimpleSelectStories.ValidationsStringNewDesign} />

### Virtual scrolling

The `enableVirtualScroll` prop can be used to enable "virtual scrolling" to only render a few options into the DOM at any one time.
This allows an unlimited amount of children to be passed with little impact on rendering performance.

By default this will render 5 not-currently-visible options into the DOM on either side of the currently-visible ones - this value can
be customised if desired using the `virtualScrollOverscan` prop. Higher values will make scrolling smoother but may negatively impact performance.

<Canvas of={SimpleSelectStories.Virtualised} />

### With multiple columns and virtualisation

<Canvas of={SimpleSelectStories.WithMultipleColumnsAndVirtualisation} />

### Selection confirmed

A change event is emitted each time an option is navigated via keyboard as it sets the value of the
Select input. For those that need to trigger further actions when the user makes a selection, there is
a `selectionConfirmed` property on the emitted event when the enter key is pressed or an option is clicked.

<Canvas of={SimpleSelectStories.SelectionConfirmedStory} />

### Dynamically adding options, and the importance of the `key` property

You must take care if you want to dynamically add `Option` children to the select, particularly if you are adding them to the start
of the list. The component uses the
[aria-activedescendant attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-activedescendant)
to expose the currently-selected option to assistive technologies such as screenreaders, and this ties in to the HTML `id` of the
option. Each option gets a randomly-generated guid as its id (if one is not explicitly provided as a prop), but to ensure that each
option keeps its id in its dynamically-changing context, a hint needs to be provided to React to keep the option's identity the same,
and not rerender it with a new guid.

This can be done by providing an appropriate [key](https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists#keeping-list-items-in-order-with-key) to
each item in the list which unique identifies it, as in the example below which simply uses the option text. This is our recommendation
for most circumstances.

An alternative solution that works is to provide an explicit `id` prop for each option.

If you do not either provide explicit ids or set keys appropriately, the `aria-activedescendant` property will get out of sync with
the selected option, generating errors with automated accessibility-testing tools, and more importantly, making the component unusable
for users who rely on assistive technology.

  name="dynamically adding options"
  of={SimpleSelectStories.SelectWithDynamicallyAddedOption}
/>

## Testing with React Testing Library (RTL)

If you use [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) in your project, you may need to mock the
`getBoundingClientRect` method of the `Element` prototype in order to correctly test the `Select` component. You can do this manually in your
test setup file, or import the `mockDOMRect` method to do it for you.

```javascript
import mockDOMRect from "carbon-react/lib/__spec_helper__/mock-dom-rect";

describe("Select tests", () => {
  beforeAll(() => {
    mockDOMRect(200, 200, "select-list-scrollable-container");
  });

  test("should render", () => {
    // your test code here
  });
})
```

## Props

### Select

<ArgTypes of={SimpleSelectStories} />

Due to the `Textbox` component being used internally by the `SimpleSelect` component, most of the `Textbox` props are applicable to `SimpleSelect`

<ArgTypes of={SelectTextboxStories} />

**Any other supplied props will be provided to the underlying HTML input element**

### Props of the Option Component

<ArgTypes of={OptionStories} />

## Translation keys

The following keys are available to override the translations for this component by passing in a custom locale object to the
[i18nProvider](../?path=/docs/documentation-i18n--docs).

<TranslationKeysTable
  translationData={[
    {
      name: "select.placeholder",
      description: "The text for the input component placeholder",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
  ]}
/>
