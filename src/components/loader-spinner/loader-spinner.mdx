Use the loader spinner to help users understand why they are waiting.

Can be used to demonstrate a known or unknown wait time.

## Quick Start

Import `LoaderSpinner` into the project.

```javascript
import { LoaderSpinner } from "carbon-react/lib/components/loader-spinner";
```

## Examples

### Default

Please see the default render of the component below. If a user prefers reduced motion, only the
loading label will be displayed.

<Canvas of={LoaderSpinnerStories.Default} />

### Override Spinner label 

Please find an example of the `spinnerLabel` prop used below, any string can be passed to the prop to override
the default `"Loading..."` label. 

<Canvas of={LoaderSpinnerStories.OverrideSpinnerLabel} />

### Sizes

Please find examples of all spinner sizes below. Ranging from sizes `extra-small` to `extra-large`.

<Canvas of={LoaderSpinnerStories.Sizes} />

### Show Spinner label

When the `showSpinnerLabel` prop is set to `false` no visual label will be rendered underneath the spinner.
A visually hidden label will still be available for assistive technologies. However, even with `showSpinnerLabel`
set to `false`, a label will still be rendered if end users have preferred reduced motion.

<Canvas of={LoaderSpinnerStories.ShowSpinnerLabel} />

### Variants

Please find examples of all spinner variants below. Shown against the ligher background are the `action` and `neutral` variants.
Against the darker background are the `inverse`, `gradient-grey` and `gradient-white` variants.

The `gradient-grey` and `gradient-white` have a slower default animation time than other variants.

<Canvas of={LoaderSpinnerStories.Variants} />

### Label color

Please find an example of a spinner below when the label color has been inverted. This will ensure proper contrast is 
achieved on the label, when used on a dark background. This is only applied with the `inverse` and `gradient-white` variants.

<Canvas of={LoaderSpinnerStories.LabelColor} />

### Has Motion

When the `hasMotion` prop is set to `false`, the motion will become static, and no animation will trigger.

<Canvas of={LoaderSpinnerStories.HasMotion} />

### Is Tracked

When the `isTracked` prop is set to `true`, the spinner will become tracked, for specific use cases where wait/loading times
are predictable. The `isTracked` prop cannot be true when the `gradient-grey` or `gradient-white` colors are set.

<Canvas of={LoaderSpinnerStories.IsTracked} />

### Animation time

The `animationTime` prop can also be set to any number, which will extend the animation time to that number in seconds.

<Canvas of={LoaderSpinnerStories.AnimationTime} />

## Translation keys

The following keys are available to override the translations for this component by passing in a custom locale object to the
[i18nProvider](../?path=/docs/documentation-i18n--docs).

<TranslationKeysTable
  translationData={[
    {
      name: "loaderSpinner.loading",
      description: "The spinner label which is shown next to the spinner, or applied to the visually hidden label if rendered.",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    }
  ]}
/>
