## Quick Start

```javascript
import Preview from "carbon-react/lib/components/preview";
```

## Examples

### Default

<Canvas of={PreviewStories.Default} />

### With Lines

You can use the `lines` prop to specify the number of placeholder shapes to render.

<Canvas of={PreviewStories.WithLines} />

### With Children

You can pass children to the component which will render when the `loading` prop is `false` or undefined.

<Canvas of={PreviewStories.WithChildren} />

### With Custom Width

You can use the `width` prop to specify the width of the Preview.

<Canvas of={PreviewStories.WithWidth} />

### With Custom Height

You can use the `height` prop to specify the height of the Preview.

<Canvas of={PreviewStories.WithHeight} />

### Shapes 

By default, the shape of the Preview is "text", however you can use the `shape` prop to change this.
You may also use the `lines` prop to render multiple Previews with the specified shape and the `width` and `height` props to change the default dimensions.

Note that when the `shape` prop is set to "circle", the `height` prop will determine the diameter and the `width` prop will be ignored.

<Canvas of={PreviewStories.Shapes} />

### Disable Animation

You can set the `disableAnimation` prop to true to disable the loading animation. This will automatically be set to true when prefer reduce-motion is enabled.

<Canvas of={PreviewStories.DisableAnimation} />
