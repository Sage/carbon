# Draggable

Pick, move and replace an order. Draggable is a great component if you need to have interactive components
with possibility to change their order with drag and drop mechanics

## Quick Start

To use the Draggable component you have to import two components: `<DraggableContainer />` and `<DraggableItem />`.

```javascript
import {
  DraggableContainer,
  DraggableItem,
  DraggableHandle,
} from "carbon-react/lib/components/draggable";
```

- Always use `DraggableItem` inside of the `DraggableContainer`
- `DraggableItem` doesn't work without `DraggableContainer`
- `DraggableItem` requires an `id` to be passed to the component
- The whole `<DraggableItem />` is draggable
- The first: `<DraggableContainer />` is a required container to let content inside of `<DraggableItem />` be draggable.
- `<DraggableItem />` Is a component that access every child to be put in.

## Examples

### Simple text as a content

<Canvas of={DraggableStories.DefaultStory} />

### With Manual Re-Ordering

The `DraggableHandle` type provides an imperative handle for control over the `DraggableItem`'s movement. 
Using a `ref`, you can access its `reOrder()` method to set manually re-order elements. 
Pass two arguments: the `id` of the `DraggableItem` you want to move and the destination index.

We recommend using the `getOrder` callback to access the current order of items. 
This provides an up-to-date reference that's essential when implementing precise positioning,
beyond simple top/bottom movements in your draggable lists.

This functionality gives users alternative ways to reposition elements when direct dragging isn't desired or possible.
