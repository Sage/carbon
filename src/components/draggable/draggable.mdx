## Quick Start

To use the Draggable component you have to import two components: `<DraggableContainer />` and `<DraggableItem />`.

```javascript
import {
  DraggableContainer,
  DraggableItem,
} from "carbon-react/lib/components/draggable";
```

- Always use `DraggableItem` inside of the `DraggableContainer`
- `DraggableItem` doesn't work without `DraggableContainer`
- `DraggableItem` requires an `id` to be passed to the component
- The whole `<DraggableItem />` is draggable
- The first: `<DraggableContainer />` is a required container to let content inside of `<DraggableItem />` be draggable.
- `<DraggableItem />` Is a component that access every child to be put in.

## Examples

### Simple text as a content

<Canvas of={DraggableStories.DefaultStory} />

### Other components as children

<Canvas of={DraggableStories.GetOrderCallbackStory} />
