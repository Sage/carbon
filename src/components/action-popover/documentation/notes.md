# Designer Notes
- Action Popovers only perform commands - they aren’t used to collect data, or choose between data items as in a form.
- Place the most common and useful actions within them. Although designs for separator rows and sub-menus are provided, these add complexity, so use them sparingly.
- Clicking the table row or tile links the user to that item. Only clicking the Action Popover's icon displays its items.
- Action popovers appear in front of all other UI elements.
- If they are in a position to be cut off by the browser or screen’s edge, the Action Popover can instead appear to the left, right, or above the element that generates it.
- Content in the popover is usually left aligned.
