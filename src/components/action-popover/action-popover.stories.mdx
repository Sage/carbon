## Quick Start

To use action popover, import `ActionPopover` alongside `ActionPopoverItem` and the other components that you would like to use in relation,
to the action popover.

```javascript
import {
  ActionPopover,
  ActionPopoverDivider,
  ActionPopoverItem,
  ActionPopoverMenu,
  ActionPopoverMenuButton,
} from "carbon-react/lib/components/action-popover";
```

  </LinkTo>
  .

### With custom menu button

ActionPopoverMenu. Expand the code example below for how to use this.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with custom menu button" story={stories.ActionPopoverComponentCustomMenuButton} />
</Canvas>

### With submenu

A menu item can be passed a sub-menu to add further sub-actions if needed. items with sub-menus will display an chevron
icons pointing in the direction that the sub-menu will open; by default it will open to the left.

Hovering the mouse cursor over an item will open the sub-menu if it has one and moving the mouse cursor away will
close it. No action is dispatched on click of the item and the sub-menu is opened by mouse enter and closed on mouse
leave.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with submenu" story={stories.ActionPopoverComponentSubmenu} />
</Canvas>

### With submenu positioned to right

Submenu can be positioned on either the left of the right with the use of the `submenuPosition` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with submenu positioned to right" story={stories.ActionPopoverComponentSubmenuPositionedRight} />
</Canvas>

### With disabled submenu

A sub-menu will not open if the item is in a disabled state.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with disabled submenu" story={stories.ActionPopoverComponentDisabledSubmenu} />
</Canvas>

### With menu opening above

The menu can also be rendered above the button control by setting using `placement="top"`.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with menu opening above" story={stories.ActionPopoverComponentMenuOpeningAbove} />
</Canvas>

### Keyboard navigation

ActionPopover and ActionPopoverItem have extensive keyboard support. It is possible to open the menu when the
ActionPopover is focused: pressing either the "enter" or "down" key will open the menu and focus the first item;
pressing the "up" key when the button is focused will open the menu and focus the last element.

Once the menu is open, it is possible to navigate the items using the "up" and "down" arrow keys. Alpha keys can also
be used as shortcuts to navigate the items: pressing a-z selects the next item in the list starting with that letter,
wrapping around to the start if required. Pressing an alpha key which doesn't match any items in the menu list will
result leave the focus on the current item.

Pressing the "enter" key will trigger the action associated with the currently focused item. Pressing either the "esc"
or "tab" key will close the menu with no action being triggered and focus the next focusable element. Pressing
"shift + tab" will close the menu and focus the previously focused element.

### Keyboard navigation left aligned submenu

Sub-menus can be accessed via the keyboard as well, when the sub-menu is left aligned it can be opened by navigating to
the parent item and pressing the "left" key. The same accessible shortcuts described above can then be used to navigate
the sub-menu. Pressing the "right" key will return focus back to the main menu and close the sub-menu without
triggering an action.

### Keyboard navigation right aligned submenu

When sub-menus aligns to the right hand side, the key shortcuts are switiched: pressingt the "right" key whilst focus
is on a item will open a sub-menu if it has one and pressing the "left" key will close it.
