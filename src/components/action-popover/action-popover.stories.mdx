# ActionPopover

ActionPopovers present a handy list of actions the user can perform on a whole table, a specific row within a table, or a tile.
Click the ellipsis icon to show actions the user can take on a specific table row, for example, emailing the invoice.

## Quick Start

To use action popover, import `ActionPopover` alongside `ActionPopoverItem` and the other components that you would like to use in relation,
to the action popover.

```javascript
import {
  ActionPopover,
  ActionPopoverDivider,
  ActionPopoverItem,
  ActionPopoverMenu,
  ActionPopoverMenuButton,
} from "carbon-react/lib/components/action-popover";
```

## Designer Notes

- Action Popovers only perform commands - they aren’t used to collect data, or choose between data items as in a form.
- Place the most common and useful actions within them. Although designs for separator rows and sub-menus are provided,
  these add complexity, so use them sparingly.
- Clicking the table row or tile links the user to that item. Only clicking the Action Popover's icon displays its items.
- Action popovers appear in front of all other UI elements.
- If they are in a position to be cut off by the browser or screen’s edge, the Action Popover can instead appear to the
  left, right, or above the element that generates it.
- Content in the popover is usually left aligned.

## Related Components

- Data entry rather than an action? <LinkTo kind='Select' story='default-story'>Try Select</LinkTo>.
- Only a single action? <LinkTo kind='Button' story='primary'>Try Button</LinkTo>.
- Doesn’t relate to a single table row or tile? <LinkTo kind='Split Button' story='default'>Try Split Button</LinkTo>, or
  <LinkTo kind="Multi Action Button" story="default">
    Multi Action Button
  </LinkTo>
  .

Story showing most of the functionality of the action popover and what can be achieved by using it

<Canvas>
  <Story name="default" story={stories.ActionPopoverComponent} />
</Canvas>

### With icons

Each item is clickable and represents an action to be taken on a given row.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with icons" story={stories.ActionPopoverComponentIcons} />
</Canvas>

### With disabled item

ActionPopoverItem&apos;s can be disabled and will not dispatch an action but can still be navigated with the keyboard.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with disabled item" story={stories.ActionPopoverComponentDisabledItems} />
</Canvas>

### With menu right aligned

It is possible to align the Menu to the right of the MenuButton by passing the &quot;rightAlignMenu&quot; to ActionPopover

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with menu right aligned" story={stories.ActionPopoverComponentMenuRightAligned} />
</Canvas>

### With item content aligned to right

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with item content aligned to right" story={stories.ActionPopoverComponentContentAlignedRight} />
</Canvas>

### With no icons

Menu items can also be displayed without icons.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with no icons" story={stories.ActionPopoverComponentNoIcons} />
</Canvas>

### With custom menu button

It is possible to use the `renderButton` prop to override the default button used to trigger the opening and closing of
ActionPopoverMenu. Expand the code example below for how to use this.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with custom menu button" story={stories.ActionPopoverComponentCustomMenuButton} />
</Canvas>

### With submenu

A menu item can be passed a sub-menu to add further sub-actions if needed. items with sub-menus will display an chevron
icons pointing in the direction that the sub-menu will open; by default it will open to the left.

Hovering the mouse cursor over an item will open the sub-menu if it has one and moving the mouse cursor away will
close it. No action is dispatched on click of the item and the sub-menu is opened by mouse enter and closed on mouse
leave.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with submenu" story={stories.ActionPopoverComponentSubmenu} />
</Canvas>

### With disabled submenu

A sub-menu will not open if the item is in a disabled state.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with disabled submenu" story={stories.ActionPopoverComponentDisabledSubmenu} />
</Canvas>

### With submenu aligned right

The sub-menu will open to the right side when there is no space to render the sub-menu to the left.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="with submenu aligned right"
    parameters={{ docs: { disable: true } }}
    story={stories.ActionPopoverComponentSubmenuAlignedRight} 
  />
</Canvas>

### With menu opening above

The menu can also be rendered above the button control by setting using `placement="top"`.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with menu opening above" story={stories.ActionPopoverComponentMenuOpeningAbove} />
</Canvas>

### Keyboard navigation

ActionPopover and ActionPopoverItem have extensive keyboard support. It is possible to open the menu when the
ActionPopover is focused: pressing either the "enter" or "down" key will open the menu and focus the first item;
pressing the "up" key when the button is focused will open the menu and focus the last element.

Once the menu is open, it is possible to navigate the items using the "up" and "down" arrow keys. Alpha keys can also
be used as shortcuts to navigate the items: pressing a-z selects the next item in the list starting with that letter,
wrapping around to the start if required. Pressing an alpha key which doesn't match any items in the menu list will
result leave the focus on the current item.

Pressing the "enter" key will trigger the action associated with the currently focused item. Pressing either the "esc"
or "tab" key will close the menu with no action being triggered and focus the next focusable element. Pressing
"shift + tab" will close the menu and focus the previously focused element.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="keyboard navigation" story={stories.ActionPopoverComponentKeyboardNavigation} />
</Canvas>

### Keyboard navigation left aligned submenu

Sub-menus can be accessed via the keyboard as well, when the sub-menu is left aligned it can be opened by navigating to
the parent item and pressing the "left" key. The same accessible shortcuts described above can then be used to navigate
the sub-menu. Pressing the "right" key will return focus back to the main menu and close the sub-menu without
triggering an action.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="keyboard navigation left aligned submenu" story={stories.ActionPopoverComponentKeyboardNaviationLeftAlignedSubmenu} />
</Canvas>

### Keyboard navigation right aligned submenu

When sub-menus aligns to the right hand side, the key shortcuts are switiched: pressingt the "right" key whilst focus
is on a item will open a sub-menu if it has one and pressing the "left" key will close it.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="keyboard navigation right aligned submenu"
    parameters={{ docs: { disable: true } }}
    story={stories.ActionPopoverComponentKeyboardNaviationRightAlignedSubmenu} 
  />
</Canvas>

### With additional options

When a row has many actions you may choose to incldue the primary actions with a dedicated action to for less frequently
used actions, in this example "manage devices".

## Translation keys

The following keys are available to override the translations for this component by passing in a custom locale object
to the [i18nProvider](https://carbon.sage.com/?path=/story/documentation-i18n--page).

<TranslationKeysTable
  translationData={[
    {
      name: "actionPopover.ariaLabel",
      description: "The text for the aria-label attribute",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
  ]}
/>
