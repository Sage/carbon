# Note

The `Note` was created using the `lexical` framework which allows rich text content to be rendered. For further documentation on this component, please read [our documentation regarding Lexical](../?path=/docs/documentation-using-lexical--docs)

## Quick Start

```javascript
import Note from "carbon-react/lib/components/note";
```

To use `Note`, use the import path above and pass the content via the `noteContent` prop.

## Examples

### Default

In its default form, the component can render plain text content by passing the value via the `noteContent` prop.

<Canvas of={NoteStories.Default} />

### With rich text content

It is possible to render rich text content: below is an example of how the component supports rendering `html` content.
Pass the value via the `noteContent` prop.

<Canvas of={NoteStories.WithRichText} />

### With title

An optional title can be provided using the `title` prop, the `title` prop can be any valid React node.
However we recommend consumers use a `Typography` component to ensure consistency.

<Canvas of={NoteStories.WithTitle} />

### With inline controls

Optional inline controls can be provided using the `inlineControl` prop. This should be an `ActionPopover`.

<Canvas of={NoteStories.WithInlineControls} />

### With status

An optional status can be provided using the `status` prop.

<Canvas of={NoteStories.WithStatus} />

### With previews

It is possible to supply link previews to the `Note` component by passing them in via the `previews` prop. Previews are
rendered as anchor elements and will behave as links, opening the page in a new tab when they are clicked or when focused
and the enter key is pressed.

<Canvas of={NoteStories.WithPreviews} />

### With margin

Margins can be applied to the `note` component using styled-system. To see a full list of available margin props, please visit
the props table at the bottom of this page.
