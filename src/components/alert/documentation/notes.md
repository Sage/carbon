# Designer Notes
- Useful if a message is so important you’d like to prevent any other activity until the user resolves it.
- If the message isn’t so important, or you want to avoid disrupting the user’s activity, consider showing a static Message component in the underlying screen.
- Include a Message component within the Alert component, use plain text, or apply a standard Carbon Error or Warning icon.
- This component has the same options and properties as the Dialog component.
