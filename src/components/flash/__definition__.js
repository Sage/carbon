  designerNotes: `
* Presents a short confirmation message to the user in a banner which can animate quickly in, and out, at the bottom of the browser window.
* Success messages disappear after a set timeout. Error messages stay on-screen until dismissed by the user.
* Useful for general success and failure messages that the user doesn’t need time to interpret. Try to place only a very short message in a Flash of just a few characters, e.g. ‘Changes Saved’.
* Various types are available. ‘Error’ and ‘Success’ are by far the most useful - others are present for completeness by may not be used in practice very often, because a Flash isn’t suitable for longer messages.
  `,
  relatedComponentsNotes: `
* Longer message which stays on-screen? [Try Message](/components/message).
* Longer, time sensitive message that must be dismissed? [Try Toast](/components/toast).
* Error or warning message that interrupts activity? [Try Alert](/components/alert).
