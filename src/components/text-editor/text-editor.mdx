# Text Editor

The `TextEditor` was created using the `draftjs` framework. It requires consuming projects to install `draftjs` as a
peer-dependency to enable it to work.

## Quick Start

```javascript
import TextEditor, {
  EditorState,
  ContentState,
} from "carbon-react/lib/components/text-editor";
```

To use the text editor , import the `TextEditor` and pass the content as as an immutable `EditorState` object.

It can be used as a controlled component where the content of the input is controlled externally, as such both
`onChange` and `value` props are required. The `labelText` and `labelId` props are also required in order to ensure
accessibility requirements are met.

## Examples

### Default

In its basic format the `TextEditor` requires three props; `value`, `onChange` and `label` props. The initial
editorState can be created empty using `EditorState.createEmpty()`, as it is below. It is also possible to render links
in the input, this can be done by manually typing or pasting a valid url into the editor. Another feature of the
component is that it supports a wide range of keyboard shortcuts to apply the various styling options: `cmd/ctrl+b`
toggles `bold`; `cmd/ctrl+i` toggles `italic`; and inputting a `*` or `1.` on a new line will render a
`unordered-list` or `ordered-list` respectively.
You can use the `required` prop to indicate if the field is mandatory.

### With content

The initial editorState can also be created with content using
`EditorState.createWithContent(ContentState.createFromText(''))`, as it is below. Other options available for
populating the content that can be found https://draftjs.org/docs/api-reference-content-state#static-methods.
It is also possible to initialise the editor with content in other formats, such as `html` or `markdown` through use of
other packages; using the methods for data conversion provided by `draftjs`
(https://draftjs.org/docs/api-reference-data-conversion/), enables the parsing of these formats into something the
editor can expects.

### With optional Save / Cancel buttons

By passing the `onSave` callback prop it is possible to render the form control buttons as seen below. This callback
will be executed when the `Save` button is clicked and there is content in the editor input, the button is disabled
otherwise. Any `onCancel` callback prop passed will be called when the `Cancel` button is clicked.

### With optional character limit

It is possible to override the default value for the character limit via the `characterLimit` prop. Setting this prop
will prevent any input that would cause the content length to exceed it.

### Character counter with translations

Various translation keys are available to assist with translating the character counter below the editor into different languages. These keys allow you to amend the messages shown when the counter exceeds or is below the set character limit.

For screen reader users, the designated `characterCount.visuallyHiddenHint` key can be used to override the message that is announced when the user stops typing.

### With validation

It is possible apply validation to the `TextEditor` component by passing the desired string message to one of the `error`,
`warning` or `info` props. When an `error` message is provided the border styling of the editor is updated to indicate
this status.

With use of `template strings` it is possible to pass multiline validation messages to the component.

### With custom row height

The `rows` prop allows for overriding the default min-height of the `TextEditor`. It accepts any number greater than 2
which is multiplied by the line-height (21px).

### With link previews

It is possible to render `EditorLinkPreview`s via the `previews` prop. The `onLinkAdded` prop provides a callback
that will allow any link added to report the url back to be used to make a call to whatever service or api you want.
Whilst in the `Editor`, these previews can be deleted by clicking or pressing the enter key, when focused, on the close
icon. This example has mocked some functionality: previews will display for any link that has a url ending in `.com`,
`.co.uk`, `.org` or `.net`. See the prop table below for the available props for the `EditorLinkPreview` component.

### Required

You can use the `required` prop to indicate if the field is mandatory.

### isOptional

You can use the `isOptional` prop to indicate if the field is optional.

## Translation keys

The following keys are available to override the translations for this component by passing in a custom locale object to the
[i18nProvider](../?path=/docs/documentation-i18n--docs).
