## Quick Start

```javascript
import TextEditor, { CreateEmpty, createFromHTML } from "carbon-react/lib/components/text-editor";
```

To use the Text Editor, import the `TextEditor` component. If your content is stored as HTML, you can use the `createFromHTML`
function to convert it to a format that the editor can understand. If you do not work with HTML, the `createFromHTML` function is not required
and can be omitted from the imports. The `CreateEmpty` function can be used to create an empty editor state, should you require one.

## Examples

### Default

All instances of the Text Editor should have a label that describes the purpose of the editor; this can be set via the `labelText` property.

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.Default} />

### Focusing the Text Editor Programmatically

```javascript
import { TextEditorHandle } from "carbon-react/lib/components/text-editor";
```

The `TextEditorHandle` type provides an imperative handle for programmatic control over the Text Editor. 
Using a `ref`, you can access its `focus()` method to set focus on the Text Editor as needed.

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.ProgrammaticFocus} />

### With Header

The Text Editor accepts a header property, which can be any valid React node and is rendered above the toolbar, providing space for custom elements such as titles, controls, or contextual information.

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.Header} />

### With Footer

The Text Editor accepts a footer property, which can be any valid React node and is rendered below the editor, providing space for custom elements such as titles, controls, or contextual information.

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.Footer} />

### With Header and Footer

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.HeaderAndFooter} />

### Using CreateEmpty

You can use the `CreateEmpty` function to create an empty editor state. This function should be called with no arguments, and the result should be passed to the `value` property of the editor.

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.UsingCreateEmpty} />

### Required

You can set the `required` property to `true` to indicate to users that the content of the editor is mandatory. 

**Note:** Since the editor input is not a conventional HTML form element, the `required` property does not enforce any default validation. It is up to the developer to ensure that the content is validated before submission.

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.Required} />

### Optional

You can set the `isOptional` property to `true` to indicate that the content of the editor is optional.

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.Optional} />

### Character Limit

You can set the `characterLimit` property to limit the number of characters that can be entered into the editor. Note that the character limit
is not a hard limit, and the user can still enter more characters than the limit. However, the editor will show a warning to indicate that the
limit has been exceeded.

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.CharacterLimit} />

### Command Buttons

You can add `Save` and `Cancel` buttons to the editor by setting the `onSave` and `onCancel` properties. Both properties should be functions.
Omitting the `onCancel` property will hide the `Cancel` button, whereas omitting the `onSave` property will hide the `Save` button.

The `onSave` function callback will be called when the user clicks the `Save` button, and contains a single argument with two values:
the JSON and HTML content of the editor. The `onCancel` function callback will be called when the user clicks the `Cancel` button.

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.CommandButtons} />

### onBlur Handler

To handle focus loss, you can set the `onBlur` property to a function. The function will be called whenever the editor loses focus.

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.OnBlur} />

### onCancel Handler

To cancel changes made to the content of the editor when the `Cancel` button is clicked, you can set the `onCancel` property to a function. This
function will be called when the user clicks the `Cancel` button.

If `value` is provided, the `Cancel` button will reset the editor to the initial value when pressed.

If the `onCancel` property is not provided, the `Cancel` button will not be displayed.

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.onCancel} />

### onChange Handler

To handle changes to the content of the editor, you can set the `onChange` property to a function. The function will be called whenever the
editor state changes, and provides a string representation of the editor content. The second argument passed to the `onChange` callback contains
the `htmlString` and `JSON` content of the editor.

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.OnChange} />

### onFocus Handler

To handle focus gain, you can set the `onFocus` property to a function. The function will be called whenever the editor gains focus.

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.OnFocus} />

### onSave Handler

To handle the content of the editor when the `Save` button is clicked, you can set the `onSave` property to a function. The callback function
returns two values: the JSON and HTML content of the editor. The value of `json` reflects the structure that the editor understands/uses
internally; the value of `htmlString` is the raw content of the editor in HTML format (note that the HTML returned is not complete HTML - only
the content of the editor is converted).

If the `onSave` property is not provided, the `Save` button will not be displayed.

Type into the editor and the click the **Show Data Formats** button in the example below to see the JSON and HTML content of the editor.

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.OnSave} />

### With HTML As Initial Value

In order to set the initial value of the editor as HTML, you can use the `createFromHTML` function to convert the HTML content to a format that
the editor can understand. The `createFromHTML` function should be called with the HTML content as an argument, and the result should be passed
to the `value` property of the editor.

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.WithHTMLValue} />

### With JSON As Initial Value

You can set the initial value of the editor by passing a JSON object to the `value` property. The JSON object provided should be in the format
returned by the `onSave` function callback, an example of which can be seen below.

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.WithJSONValue} />

### Input Hint

You can use the `inputHint` property to provide additional information to the user about the expected content or usage of the editor.

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.InputHint} />

### With Row Count

You can customise the height of the text editor by setting the `rows` property. The `rows` property should be a number greater than `2`, and will
determine the minimum height of the editor by multiplying the number of rows provided by the height of a single row (21px). If `rows` is not provided,
the editor will default to a height of `210px`, equivalent to 10 rows (note that more than 10 rows of content can be added; setting the `rows` prop
only sets the minimum height of the editor).

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.Rows} />

### With Placeholder

By default, the editor will render with an empty placeholder; you can override this by setting the `placeholder` property.

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.WithPlaceholder} />

### Link Support

The editor supports adding links to text. To add a link, you can:

 - type the link directly into the editor;
 - select the text you want to link, and paste the URL directly into the editor. The editor will automatically convert the URL into a link, wrapping the selected text.

Clicking the link will open the URL in a new tab.

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.Links} />

### With Link Added Callback

There may be times when you want to perform an action when a link is added to the editor. You can use the `onLinkAdded` callback to obtain a
string representation of the link that was added, updated or removed. The function will be called whenever a link is added to the editor.
In the example below, the most recently-added link will be displayed in the `Link` section below the editor; adding a new link will replace
the previous one.

Note that this usage is for demonstration purposes only; you should maintain the list of URLs added to the editor in your application state.

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.WithLinkAddedCallback} />

### With Link Previews

You can use the `previews` property to render previews of links added to the editor. The `previews` property should be an array of React JSX objects. Note
that the following examples are merely a suggested implementation; the only requirement is that the `previews` array contains one or more React JSX
objects.

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.WithLinkPreviews} />

You can provide more complex previews by providing custom components to the `previews` array.

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.WithComplexLinkPreviews} />

You can also provide multiple previews, and can mix and match the styles as desired.

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.WithMultipleLinkPreviews} />

### Translations

You can override the default translations for the Text Editor by passing a custom locale object to the `i18nProvider`. Consult the [translation keys](#translation-keys) section for a list of available keys.

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.WithCustomTranslations} />

### Read-Only Mode

You can specify that the editor should be read-only by setting the `readOnly` property to `true`. In read-only mode, the editor will not allow any changes to be made to the content.

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.ReadOnly} />

### Multiple Editors

You can render multiple instances of the Text Editor on the same page. Each editor should have a unique `namespace` property, which is used to identify
the editor when monitoring for formatting changes, accessible navigation, etc.

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.MultipleEditors} />

### With Custom Plugins

The `customPlugins` prop allows consumers of the `TextEditor` component to inject one or more custom [Lexical](https://lexical.dev/) plugins. This provides flexibility to extend the editor with features like mentions, emoji pickers, custom toolbars, and more — without modifying the core editor. This prop is optional and supports a single plugin, multiple plugins (via fragments or arrays), or `null`.

#### Example: Creating and Using a Custom Plugin

```tsx
// CustomWordCountPlugin.tsx
import { useLexicalComposerContext } from '@lexical/react/LexicalComposerContext';
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { $getRoot } from 'lexical';

const CustomWordCountPlugin = () => {
  // Get the Lexical editor instance from context
  const [editor] = useLexicalComposerContext();
  // Local state to store the current word count
  const [wordCount, setWordCount] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    // Register a listener to run every time the editor updates
    return editor.registerUpdateListener(({ editorState }) => {
      // Read the editor state in a read-only context
      editorState.read(() => {
        // Get the full text content from the root of the editor
        const text = $getRoot().getTextContent();
        // Split the text by whitespace and count non-empty words
        const count = text.trim().split(/\s+/).filter(Boolean).length;
        // Update local word count state
        setWordCount(count);
      });
    });
  }, [editor]); // Only run this effect once per editor instance
  // Render the word count UI with styled container
  return (
    <Typography ml={1} mb={0}>
      Word Count: {wordCount}
    </Typography>
  );
};
```

```tsx
// Using it with TextEditor
import TextEditor from './TextEditor';
import { CustomWordCountPlugin } from './CustomWordCountPlugin';

const App = () => (
  <TextEditor labelText="Text Editor" customPlugins={<CustomWordCountPlugin />} />
);
```
