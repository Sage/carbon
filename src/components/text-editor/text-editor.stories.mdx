# Text Editor

The `TextEditor` was created using the `draftjs` framework. It requires consuming projects to install `draftjs` as a
peer-dependency to enable it to work.

## Quick Start

```javascript
import TextEditor, {
  EditorState,
  ContentState,
} from "carbon-react/lib/components/text-editor";
```

To use the text editor , import the `TextEditor` and pass the content as as an immutable `EditorState` object.

It can be used as a controlled component where the content of the input is controlled externally, as such both
`onChange` and `value` props are required. The `labelText` and `labelId` props are also required in order to ensure
accessibility requirements are met.

## Examples

### Default

In its basic format the `TextEditor` requires three props; `value`, `onChange` and `label` props. The initial
editorState can be created empty using `EditorState.createEmpty()`, as it is below. It is also possible to render links
in the input, this can be done by manually typing or pasting a valid url into the editor. Another feature of the
component is that it supports a wide range of keyboard shortcuts to apply the various styling options: `cmd/ctrl+b`
toggles `bold`; `cmd/ctrl+i` toggles `italic`; and inputting a `*` or `1.` on a new line will render a
`unordered-list` or `ordered-list` respectively.
You can use the `required` prop to indicate if the field is mandatory.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.Default} name="default" />
</Canvas>

### With content

The initial editorState can also be created with content using
`EditorState.createWithContent(ContentState.createFromText(''))`, as it is below. Other options available for
populating the content that can be found https://draftjs.org/docs/api-reference-content-state#static-methods.
It is also possible to initialise the editor with content in other formats, such as `html` or `markdown` through use of
other packages; using the methods for data conversion provided by `draftjs`
(https://draftjs.org/docs/api-reference-data-conversion/), enables the parsing of these formats into something the
editor can expects.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.WithContent} name="with content" />
</Canvas>

### With optional Save / Cancel buttons

By passing the `onSave` callback prop it is possible to render the form control buttons as seen below. This callback
will be executed when the `Save` button is clicked and there is content in the editor input, the button is disabled
otherwise. Any `onCancel` callback prop passed will be called when the `Cancel` button is clicked.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with optional buttons" story={stories.WithOptionalButtons} />
</Canvas>

### With optional character limit

It is possible to override the default value for the character limit via the `characterLimit` prop. Setting this prop
will prevent any input that would cause the content length to exceed it.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="with optional character limit"
    story={stories.WithOptionalCharacterLimit}
  />
</Canvas>

### With validation

It is possible apply validation to the `TextEditor` component by passing the desired string message to one of the `error`,
`warning` or `info` props. When an `error` message is provided the border styling of the editor is updated to indicate
this status.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with validation" story={stories.WithValidation} />
</Canvas>

With use of `template strings` it is possible to pass multiline validation messages to the component.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="with multiline validation"
    story={stories.WithMultilineValidation}
  />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with new validation" story={stories.WithNewValidation} />
</Canvas>

### With custom row height

The `rows` prop allows for overriding the default min-height of the `TextEditor`. It accepts any number greater than 2
which is multiplied by the line-height (21px).

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with custom row height" story={stories.WithCustomRowHeight} />
</Canvas>

### With link previews

It is possible to render `EditorLinkPreview`s via the `previews` prop. The `onLinkAdded` prop provides a callback
that will allow any link added to report the url back to be used to make a call to whatever service or api you want.
Whilst in the `Editor`, these previews can be deleted by clicking or pressing the enter key, when focused, on the close
icon. This example has mocked some functionality: previews will display for any link that has a url ending in `.com`,
`.co.uk`, `.org` or `.net`. See the prop table below for the available props for the `EditorLinkPreview` component.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with link previews" story={stories.WithLinkPreviews} />
</Canvas>

## Translation keys

The following keys are available to override the translations for this component by passing in a custom locale object to the
[i18nProvider](https://carbon.sage.com/?path=/story/documentation-i18n--page).

<TranslationKeys
  translationData={[
    {
      name: "textEditor.ariaLabels.bold",
      type: "func",
      description:
        "text to be read out by a screen reader when bold toolbar button is navigated to",
      returnType: "string",
    },
    {
      name: "textEditor.ariaLabels.italic",
      type: "func",
      description:
        "text to be read out by a screen reader when italic toolbar button is navigated to",
      returnType: "string",
    },
    {
      name: "textEditor.ariaLabels.bulletList",
      type: "func",
      description:
        "text to be read out by a screen reader when bullet list toolbar button is navigated to",
      returnType: "string",
    },
    {
      name: "textEditor.ariaLabels.numberList",
      type: "func",

      type: "func",
      description: "visible when the user hovers over the bold toolbar button",

      returnType: "string",
    },
    {
      name: "textEditor.tooltipMessages.bulletList",
      type: "func",
      description:
        "visible when the user hovers over the bullet list toolbar button",
      returnType: "string",
    },
    {

      type: "func",
