  Product Design System component
</a>

Provide a way to represent an end-to-end journey that a user can complete in one go.

This component has a specific start and end point, as well as showing the current step in the journey.

Use a step flow to help a user complete tasks in a specific order, based on their needs.

## Quick Start

```js
import StepFlow from "carbon-react/lib/components/step-flow";
```

## Examples

To ensure focus is programmatically moved to the `title` of a given `StepFlow` when a user advances through each step,  
passing a `ref` is **strongly** recommended. This ensures screen reader users are made aware of all information throughout the user journey
An example of how this can be achieved is provided in the **Example implementation** story.

### Default

<Canvas of={StepFlowStories.DefaultStory} />

### with category

<Canvas of={StepFlowStories.CategoryStory} />

### with showProgressIndicator

You can set the `showProgressIndicator` prop to `true` to render the progress indicator within the component.

<Canvas of={StepFlowStories.ShowProgressIndicatorStory} />

### with currentStep

The `currentStep` prop can be used to set the current step, this will update the step label and update the progress indicator. Your
current step can be between `1` and `8`.

<Canvas of={StepFlowStories.CurrentStepStory} />

### with totalSteps

The `totalSteps` prop can be used to change the amount of steps, this will update the step label and determine the amount of step indicators rendered.
You can have between `1` and `8` total steps.

<Canvas of={StepFlowStories.TotalStepsStory} />

### with showCloseIcon

You can set the `showCloseIcon` prop to `true` to render a close icon within the component. You can also use the `onDismiss` prop to pass in a function
which is called when a user clicks on the close icon.

<Canvas of={StepFlowStories.ShowCloseIconStory} />

### Example implementation

Please see below an example implementation of how the component can be used within the `Dialog` component, with the use of `Button`'s to advance through the user
journey. Within the `Dialog` component, the `title` prop accepts a node, so the component can be passed, acting as the `Dialog`'s title. Also `showCloseIcon` can
also be passed to render the close icon, and its `onDismiss` function can be used to close the modal instead of passing `onCancel` to `Dialog`.

Also, the example below fully details the use of a ref to programmatically move focus to a title div which contains all of the necessary information for screen reader users
(`title`, `currentStep`, `totalSteps` and `category` if added), in the form of a properly formatted, visually hidden string.

Please see below an example of what this look like in the DOM.

```jsx
<span data-element="visually-hidden-title-text">
  Add client. Transaction Type. Step 1 of 3.
</span>
```

<Canvas of={StepFlowStories.ExampleImplementation} />

To achieve this, a custom ref handle can be forwarded to the `StepFlow` component:

```tsx
const stepFlowHandle = useRef<StepFlowHandle>(null);
return (
  <StepFlow
    title="Refund details"
    totalSteps={3}
    currentStep={1}
    ref={stepFlowHandle}
  />
);
```

which exposes the `focus()` method of `StepFlow`'s root DOM node:

```ts
stepFlowHandle.current?.focus();
```

This will ensure that screen reader users are not only made aware of any changes to information, but can then also navigate down the page from the `StepFlow` component as they see fit.

### Example implementation with translations

Various translations can be applied to both the step label, screen reader only title and close icon aria-label.

When providing the screen reader only title the `title`, `category` (if provided), `currentStep` and `totalSteps`, have all been passed to ensure screen reader users have all of the same information
as users who can see the component. Please see below how this has been achieved with a French translation.

<Canvas of={StepFlowStories.ExampleImplementationWithTranslations} />

## Translation keys

The following keys are available to override the translations for this component by passing in a custom locale object to the
[i18nProvider](../?path=/docs/documentation-i18n--docs).

<TranslationKeysTable
  translationData={[
    {
      name: "stepFlow.stepLabel",
      description:
        "The step label which shows the current step and the amount of total steps.",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
    {
      name: "stepFlow.screenReaderOnlyTitle",
      description:
        "The full visually hidden sentence which will be announced to users detailing their category, title, current steps and total steps.",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
    {
      name: "stepFlow.closeIconAriaLabel",
      description:
        "The aria label of the close icon which is rendered when 'showCloseIcon' is true.",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
  ]}
/>
