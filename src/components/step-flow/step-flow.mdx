  Product Design System component
</a>

Provide a way to represent an end-to-end journey that a user can complete in one go.

This component has a specific start and end point, as well as showing the current step in the journey.

Use a step flow to help a user complete tasks in a specific order, based on their needs.

## Quick Start

```js
import { StepFlow, StepFlowTitle, StepFlowHandle, Steps } from "carbon-react/lib/components/step-flow";
```

## Examples

To ensure focus is programmatically moved to the `title` of a given `StepFlow` when a user advances through each step,  
passing a `ref` is **strongly** recommended. This ensures screen reader users are made aware of all information throughout the user journey
An example of how this can be achieved is provided in the **Example implementation** story.

### Default

<Canvas of={StepFlowStories.DefaultStory} />

### Step Flow Title node

To allow a compositional approach, the `title` prop accepts a node. This can be used to compose custom content to be passed as the title of the `StepFlow` component.
However, it is important to note that it is recommended that the `StepFlowTitle` sub component should be a descendant of the passed node.

<Canvas of={StepFlowStories.TitleNodeStory} />

### Step Flow Title node with a screen reader only title

The `screenReaderOnlyTitle` prop can be used to pass a custom screen reader only title. This is useful for providing screen reader users with all of the necessary information or context
which may not be available visually.

<Canvas of={StepFlowStories.TitleNodeStoryWithScreenReaderOnlyTitle} />

Please see below an example of what this look like in the DOM.

```jsx
<span data-element="visually-hidden-title-text">
  Step Title with a pointer image. Step 1 of 3.
</span>
```

### with category

<Canvas of={StepFlowStories.CategoryStory} />

### with showProgressIndicator

You can set the `showProgressIndicator` prop to `true` to render the progress indicator within the component.

<Canvas of={StepFlowStories.ShowProgressIndicatorStory} />

### with currentStep

The `currentStep` prop can be used to set the current step, this will update the step label and update the progress indicator. Your
current step can be between `1` and `8`.

<Canvas of={StepFlowStories.CurrentStepStory} />

### with totalSteps

The `totalSteps` prop can be used to change the amount of steps, this will update the step label and determine the amount of step indicators rendered.
You can have between `1` and `8` total steps.

<Canvas of={StepFlowStories.TotalStepsStory} />

### with showCloseIcon

You can set the `showCloseIcon` prop to `true` to render a close icon within the component. You can also use the `onDismiss` prop to pass in a function
which is called when a user clicks on the close icon.

<Canvas of={StepFlowStories.ShowCloseIconStory} />

### Example implementation

Please see below an example implementation of how the component can be used within the `Dialog` component, with the use of `Button`'s to advance through the user
journey. Within the `Dialog` component, the `title` prop accepts a node, so the component can be passed, acting as the `Dialog`'s title. Also `showCloseIcon` can
also be passed to render the close icon, and its `onDismiss` function can be used to close the modal instead of passing `onCancel` to `Dialog`.

Also, the example below fully details the use of a ref to programmatically move focus to a title div which contains all of the necessary information for screen reader users
(`title`, `currentStep`, `totalSteps` and `category` if added), in the form of a properly formatted, visually hidden string.

Please see below an example of what this look like in the DOM.

```jsx
<span data-element="visually-hidden-title-text">
  Add client. Transaction Type. Step 1 of 3.
</span>
```

<Canvas of={StepFlowStories.ExampleImplementation} />

To achieve this, a custom ref handle can be forwarded to the `StepFlow` component:

```tsx
const stepFlowHandle = useRef<StepFlowHandle>(null);
return (
  <StepFlow
    title="Refund details"
    totalSteps={3}
    currentStep={1}
    ref={stepFlowHandle}
  />
);
```

which exposes the `focus()` method of `StepFlow`'s root DOM node:

```ts
stepFlowHandle.current?.focus();
```

This will ensure that screen reader users are not only made aware of any changes to information, but can then also navigate down the page from the `StepFlow` component as they see fit.

## Translation keys

The following keys are available to override the translations for this component by passing in a custom locale object to the
[i18nProvider](../?path=/docs/documentation-i18n--docs).

<TranslationKeysTable
  translationData={[
    {
      name: "stepFlow.stepLabel",
      description:
        "The step label which shows the current step and the amount of total steps.",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
    {
      name: "stepFlow.screenReaderOnlyTitle",
      description:
        "The full visually hidden sentence which will be announced to users detailing their category, title, current steps and total steps.",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
    {
      name: "stepFlow.closeIconAriaLabel",
      description:
        "The aria label of the close icon which is rendered when 'showCloseIcon' is true.",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
  ]}
/>
