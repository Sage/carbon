  designerNotes: `
* Nest any Carbon input into this component.
* Configure Pod and Fieldset components to work together, or choose this pre-configured Show/Edit Pod component:
* The Show/Edit Pod Component automatically presents content as a read-only Pod, until the user clicks an edit icon, which shows the same information in an editable Fieldset.
* But, configuring Pod and Fieldset components manually will give you more customization options.
* Choose whether the editable state has a disabled or enabled Save button, a Cancel button, or a Delete button, and their alignment.
* Choose from various visual options, including borders, and primary, secondary, or tertiary appearance.
* Set the pod to flex to the width of its content, or take up the full width of its container.
* Top-aligned labels (Carbon default) or inline right-aligned labels are usually fastest for users.
* Create a single path to completion with your inputs, and between your inputs and the primary action Button.
* Indicate mandatory, or optional fields, whichever is the minority. Think carefully before collecting optional data - don’t collect information you don’t need! Try suffixing ‘(optional)’ after your field label.
* More guidance is available for each of the individual inputs you might place inside this component.
