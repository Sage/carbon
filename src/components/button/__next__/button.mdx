A Button triggers a single action or event.
Use it to submit a form (Save), to advance to the next step in a process (Next), or to create a new item (New).

**This documentation is for the newer implementation of Button. If you are still using the older implementation, please use the <a href="../?path=/docs/deprecated-button--docs">Button documentation</a>.**

## Quickstart

```javascript
import Button from "carbon-react/lib/components/button/__next__";
```

## Examples

### Default Button

By default, a `Button` with no additional properties pass will render a default
primary button, with the `button` HTML type.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Default} />

### Click Handler

To make use of non-submit and non-reset buttons, provide an `onClick` handler to
enable actions to take place when users click the button.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.ClickHandler} />

### Variants

Buttons come in three variants: `default`, `destructive` and `ai`. To set your
desired variant, pass the `variant` prop; if no value is passed, `default` is
used.

Similarly, variants can be one of up to four variant types: `primary`,
`secondary`, `tertiary` and `subtle`. Supported variant-type combinations are
as follows:

| Variant       | Primary | Secondary | Tertiary | Subtle |
| ------------- | ------- | --------- | -------- | ------ |
| `default`     | ✅      | ✅        | ✅       | ✅     |
| `destructive` | ✅      | ✅        | ❌       | ❌     |
| `ai`          | ❌      | ✅        | ❌       | ❌     |

By default, the `primary` variant type will be used if no `variantType` property
is passed

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Variations} />

### Sizes

Buttons can be one of four sizes: `xs`, `small`, `medium` and `large`. Pass the
required size with the `size` property.

#### A note on the `xs` size

The `xs` button size is designed for use only in tables where spacing is limited;
**it is not meant for use beyond that**. XS buttons cannot use the `primary`
variant type, and will instead default to `secondary` if no variant is specified.
If `primary` is set, it will be ignored automatically.

### Disabled

You can disable buttons using the `disabled` property. Before doing that, think
about whether a disabled button really makes sense for your situation — it's
best to save this option for times when other approaches won’t quite do the job.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Disabled} />

### Full-Width

Passing the `fullWidth` property will allow buttons to use the full horizontal
space around them.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.FullWidth} />

### Icons

Buttons can have an icon associated with them. Pass the `iconType` property to
the button ([a full list of icons is available here](../?path=/story/icon--list-of-icons)).

You can use the `iconPosition` prop to determine whether the icon appears on
the left or right of the text.

Additionally, buttons can also be icon-only; simply pass an `iconType` and
self-close the `Button` element:

```ts
  <Button iconType="home" aria-label="Return to the home page" />
```

If using icon-only buttons, please make sure that they are marked up correctly
by passing `aria-label` as a prop to ensure that they are announced to
assistive technologies correctly.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Icons} />

### Inverse

Buttons can be marked as `inverse` for scenarios where they require a dark mode
appearance. Only the `default` variant supports `inverse`; other variants will
be ignored.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Inverse} />

### Loading

Loading state can be applied to buttons by passing the `loading` prop. To show
different text, use the [Loader translation keys](../?path=/docs/loader--docs#translation-keys)

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Loading} />

### Wrapping Text

If you require button text that does not wrap (due to e.g. limited spacing),
use the `noWrap` prop to prevent the text from wrapping across multiple
lines.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.WrappingText} />

### HTML Button Type

Standard HTML buttons can be one of three types: `button`, `submit` or
`reset`. This functionality is available via the `type` prop, which
allows `Button` instances to be used as standard buttons in elements
such as forms.
