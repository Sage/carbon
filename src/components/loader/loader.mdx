  Product Design System component
</a>

Use the Loader component to let users know a task or loading data is still in progress.
Showing a Loader helps the user to understand that they should wait, rather than reload the page or abandon a process.
In general, place a Loader in the centre and middle of the page or container it relates to.
Like many Design System elements, Loaders are made of square elements. They usually take the accent colour of the product they're in.

    },
  ]}
