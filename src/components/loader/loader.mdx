## Quick Start

Import `Loader` into the project.

```javascript
import Loader from "carbon-react/lib/components/loader";
```

## Examples

### Default

This example of the Loader component demonstrates how it will appear as default.

<Canvas of={LoaderStories.Default} />

### with gradient variant

This is an example of the Loader component with the `variant` prop set to `gradient`.

<Canvas of={LoaderStories.WithGradientVariant} />

### Small

This is an example of a small Loader component.

<Canvas of={LoaderStories.Small} />

### Large

This is an example of the large Loader component. The larger size is only used when a whole page is loading.

<Canvas of={LoaderStories.Large} />

### Inside Buttons

This example shows a `Loader` nested inside of a `Button` component. To ensure that the correct styling is applied to the `Loader` component when it is nested inside of the `Button` component,
please remember to pass the `isInsideButton` prop to the `Loader` component.

<Canvas of={LoaderStories.InsideButton} />

### Conditional Rendering

In most cases, Loaders are conditionally rendered on the page and are then replaced by content. 
It is important to wrap the relevant content in a `span` (when elements are inline) or a `div` (when elements are in a block) and pass the `aria-live` attribute with the value of `polite`. 

Please note that ARIA live regions provide a means for conveying dynamic updates to users who rely on assistive technologies like screen readers. 
By incorporating live regions permanently into the DOM, we can ensure that users are consistently informed of relevant changes as they occur.

## Translation keys

The following keys are available to override the translations for this component by passing in a custom locale object
to the [i18nProvider](../?path=/docs/documentation-i18n--docs).

<TranslationKeysTable
  translationData={[
    {
      name: "loader.loading",
      description:
        "An accessible name for `Loader`. This will also be used as alternative text to replace the loading animation - if the user requests for minimal motion-based animation (via their OS accessibility settings).",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
  ]}
/>
