# Loader

Use the Loader component to let users know a task or loading data is still in progress.
Showing a Loader helps the user to understand that they should wait, rather than reload the page or abandon a process.
In general, place a Loader in the centre and middle of the page or container it relates to.
Like many Design System elements, Loaders are made of square elements. They usually take the accent colour of the product they're in.

## Quick Start

Import `Loader` into the project.

```javascript
import Loader from "carbon-react/lib/components/loader";
```

## Examples

### Default

This example of the Loader component demonstrates how it will appear as default.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="default">
    <Loader />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Small

This is an example of a small Loader component.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="small">
    <Loader size="small" />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Large

This is an example of the large Loader component. The larger size is only used when a whole page is loading.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="large">
    <Loader size="large" />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Inside Buttons

This is an example of the Loader nested inside of a Button component. When used inside a primary button the colour of the squares will be white.
To ensure that the correct styling is applied to the `Loader` component when it is nested inside of the `Button` component,
please remember to pass the `isInsideButton` prop to the `Loader` component.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="inside Buttons">
    <Button buttonType="primary" aria-label="Loading">
      <Loader isInsideButton />
    </Button>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Props

### Loader

<StyledSystemProps of={Loader} noHeader margin />
