  Product Design System component 
</a>

Use the Loader component to let users know a task or loading data is still in progress.
Showing a Loader helps the user to understand that they should wait, rather than reload the page or abandon a process.
In general, place a Loader in the centre and middle of the page or container it relates to.
Like many Design System elements, Loaders are made of square elements. They usually take the accent colour of the product they're in.

## Quick Start

Import `Loader` into the project.

```javascript
import Loader from "carbon-react/lib/components/loader";
```

## Examples

### Default

This example of the Loader component demonstrates how it will appear as default.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="default" story={stories.Default} />
</Canvas>

### Small

This is an example of a small Loader component.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="small" story={stories.Small} />
</Canvas>

### Large

This is an example of the large Loader component. The larger size is only used when a whole page is loading.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="large" story={stories.Large} />
</Canvas>

### Inside Buttons

These examples show a `Loader` nested inside of a `Button` component. To ensure that the correct styling is applied to the `Loader` component when it is nested inside of the `Button` component,
please remember to pass the `isInsideButton` prop to the `Loader` component.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="inside Buttons" story={stories.InsideButtons} />
</Canvas>

## Props

### Loader

<StyledSystemProps of={Loader} noHeader margin />

      name: "loader.loading",
      description:
        "An accessible name for `Loader`. This will also be used as alternative text to replace the loading animation - if the user requests for minimal motion-based animation (via their OS accessibility settings).",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
  ]}
