## Quick Start

```javascript
import FileInput from "carbon-react/lib/components/file-input";
```

## Examples

### Default

<Canvas>
  <Story name="default" story={stories.Default} />
</Canvas>

### With inputHint

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with inputHint" story={stories.WithInputHint} />
</Canvas>

### Required

You can use the `required` prop to indicate if the field is mandatory.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="required" story={stories.Required} />
</Canvas>

### Size variations

By default the component has a width of 256px and height of 40px (not including 12px of padding on each side). This makes both text and button
render on a single line (as seen in all the examples above).

You can increase the width and/or height component by setting the `maxHeight` and/or `maxWidth` props. You might need to do this to fit especially long
explanatory text, or to match the precise width/height of a particular design. Examples of increasing width and height are shown below:

#### Increased height

<Canvas>
  <Story name="increased height" story={stories.IncreasedHeight} />
</Canvas>

#### Both height and width increased

<Canvas>
  <Story name="increased width and height" story={stories.IncreasedBoth} />
</Canvas>

#### Full width example

Note that any valid CSS values can be used for these props, and that you can therefore set the `maxWidth` to `"100%"` to fill out the entire container width:

<Canvas>
  <Story name="100% width" story={stories.FullWidth} />
</Canvas>

#### Responsive increased width example

It isn't recommended to increase the `maxWidth` to more than 320px without also increasing the `maxHeight`, as this could lead to the text overflowing the
container on smaller mobile devices. If you really need to put the text and button on the same row if space allows, you can use the CSS `min` function to
ensure no horizontal overflow, and the <LinkTo kind="documentation-hooks-useMediaQuery">useMediaQuery</LinkTo> hook to set the `maxHeight` conditionally on
smaller screen-sizes, as illustratred below:

<Canvas>
  <Story name="increased width - responsive" story={stories.IncreasedWidthResponsive} />
</Canvas>

#### Vertical layout

One common variation is to have the text vertically stacked below the button, without necessarily increasing the width. This can be achieved by setting the
`isVertical` boolean prop. Note that this is equivalent to simply removing the default `maxHeight` value and will be overridden if `maxHeight` is explicitly
provided - so `maxHeight` should not be used in conjunction with `isVertical`. (A sufficiently large `maxHeight` will make the component lay out vertically
anyway.)

<Canvas>
  <Story name="vertical" story={stories.Vertical} />
</Canvas>

### Validations

Validation status can be set by passing an `error` or prop to the component

Passing a string will display a properly colored border and error message.

Passing a boolean to these props will display only a properly colored border.

For more information check our [Validations](?path=/docs/documentation-validations--page "Validations") documentation page.

NOTE: old-style tooltip validation is not supported for this component - no matter whether the nearest wrapping `CarbonProvider` sets the `validationRedesignOptIn` flag or not.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="validations" story={stories.Validation} />
</Canvas>

### Accept

The `accept` prop is passed directly to the underlying HTML `<input type="file">` element, and helps guide users towards uploading files of the correct format or type.

Please see the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/accept) for more details on this attribute. Note that it does not prevent the user
from uploading a file of the incorrect type, for example via drag and drop - so you might still want to use the `onChange` prop to add an error message as soon as an
inappropriate file is added. And of course nothing takes away the need for validation on the server side. However the `accept` prop is still recommended to guide the user
- when selecting a file via the "select file" button, the operating system's file picker will either highlight the appropriate files, or make it impossible to select
incorrect ones.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="accept" story={stories.Accept} />
</Canvas>

### Validation of file type

Here is a simple example showing how the `onChange` and `error` props can be used in conjunction with `accept` to warn the user if they have chosen an inappropriate
file.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="validation example" story={stories.FileTypeValidation} />
</Canvas>

### Tracking upload status

The `uploadStatus` prop is used to indicate when one or more files have been added, as well as the current status/progress of
the upload - and allowing users to cancel or remove uploaded files. It is required to set this (to an actual props object, or to
a non-empty array for multiple files) in order for the users to see any indication of the uploaded file(s).

For this reason the `onChange` function prop is mandatory - without providing an implementation for this event handler that updates the
components `uploadStatus`, there will be no visual change once a file has been added to the input.

#### Client side example

Here is a relatively simple example of using a [FileReader](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader) to track progress purely
on the client side, resulting in storing the file locally as a `data:` URL. This is a way to show users a preview of their file if you do not intend
to track upload progress on the server, or do not actually send the files to a server until form submission.

Note the use of a `ref` to store the `FileReader` object - this is not essential but avoids having to create a new `FileReader` object more than once in the
lifecycle of the component.

This example also contains validation to restrict the user from uploading large files - this is useful because storing a large file in memory may make the
browser freeze or even crash. If your application needs to process large files on the client side then consider
[reading the file into an ArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader/readAsArrayBuffer) and processing that piece-by-piece.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="tracking upload status on client side" story={stories.UploadStatusClient} />
</Canvas>

#### Other approaches

This example mocks an alternative approach where files added to the file input are immediately sent to the server, and the UI tracks the progress of the upload.
This simple example mocks the progress (and the possibility of errors, such as network errors) with random numbers - in a real scenario this would poll an
alternative endpoint for the upload progress, or use WebSocket messages sent from the server to update progress.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="tracking upload status alternative" story={stories.UploadStatusAlternative} />
</Canvas>

#### Uploading without progress percentage

Note that you can set the `uploading` without the `progress` property, to renders an
animated <LinkTo kind="LoaderBar" story="default">LoaderBar</LinkTo> component, rather
that a <LinkTo kind="ProgressBar" story="default">ProgressBar</LinkTo> as it does when `progress` is provided.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with loader animation" story={stories.UploadStatusNoProgress} />
</Canvas>

## Props

### File Input

<StyledSystemProps of={FileInput} noHeader margin />

Props for the `uploadStatus` prop. Note that only `status`,`filename` and `onAction` are required, and the other props are specific
to the appropriate status(es) as described below.

Note in particular that, other than the 3 props noted above, and the `message` and `progress` props, all others are the same as the props of
the <LinkTo kind="Link" story="default">Link</LinkTo> component, to override the props of the link to the uploaded file. There is one exception here however,
in that the `href` prop is mandatory. Note that none of these `Link` props can be given except for the statuses `completed` and `previously`.

<ArgsTable of={FileUploadStatus} />

## Translation keys

The following keys are available to override the translations for this component by passing in a custom locale object to the
[i18nProvider](https://carbon.sage.com/?path=/story/documentation-i18n--page).

<TranslationKeysTable
  translationData={[
    {
      name: "fileInput.selectFile",
      description: "The text for the button that opens the file picker",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
    {
      name: "fileInput.dragAndDrop",
      description: "The default text inside the input area",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
    {
      name: "fileInput.fileUploadStatus",
      description: "The default status to display while or after uploading a file",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
    {
      name: "fileInput.actions.cancel",
      description: "The text for the button that cancels an in-progress upload",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
        {
      name: "fileInput.actions.delete",
      description: "The text for the button that deletes an uploaded file",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
    {
      name: "fileInput.actions.clear",
      description: "The text for the button that clears a file that has led to an error in upload",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
  ]}
/>
