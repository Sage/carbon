## Quick Start

To use these components, import both `RadioButtonGroup` and `RadioButton`, and pass the radio buttons as children of the radio group.

```javascript
import {
  RadioButton,
  RadioButtonGroup,
} from "carbon-react/lib/components/radio-button";
```

## Related Components

- Choosing more than one option? [Try Checkbox](/docs/checkbox--default-story "Try Checkbox").
- Choosing one option from a highly visible small range? [Try Button Toggle](/story/button-toggle--default "Try Button Toggle").

## Examples

### Default

<Canvas>
  <Story name="default" story={stories.Default} />
</Canvas>

### With legend and labels

A legend can be set for the group, and each radio button can have a label.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with legend and labels" story={stories.WithLegendAndLabels} />
</Canvas>


### With inline legend

The legend can be made inline. Its width can be changed with the `legendWidth` prop, its text alignment with `legendAlign`.

The spacing between the legend and the radio buttons can be changed with the `legendSpacing` prop, this can be `1` or `2`, which is multiplied by the base theme spacing constant of `8px`, so therefore `8px` or `16px`. The default is `2` for this prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with inline legend" story={stories.WithInlineLegend} />
</Canvas>

### With left margin

A `ml` prop can be supplied to align the `RadioButtonGroup` with above and below components. This prop is a CSS string.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with left margin" story={stories.WithLeftMargin} />
</Canvas>

### Enable adaptive behaviour

Passing in the `adaptiveLegendBreakpoint` and `adaptiveSpacingBreakpoint` props will enable the adaptive behaviour.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="enable adaptive behaviour" story={stories.EnableAdaptiveBehaviour} />
</Canvas>

### Different label spacing

The spacing between radio buttons and their labels can be changed with the `labelSpacing` prop. Similarly to the `legendSpacing` prop, this is a number which is multiplied by the base theme spacing constant. It defaults to `1` which is therefore `8px`.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="different label spacing" story={stories.DifferentLabelSpacing} />
</Canvas>

### Inline radio buttons

The radio buttons can be made inline with the `inline` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="inline radio buttons" story={stories.InlineRadioButtons} />
</Canvas>

### Reverse radio buttons

The radio buttons and labels can be flipped around using the `reverse` prop on each radio button. The same spacing options between the label and radio button as above apply.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="reverse radio buttons" story={stories.ReverseRadioButtons} />
</Canvas>

### Disable radio buttons

The radio buttons and labels can be disabled using the `disabled` prop on each radio button.

**Please Note**: Even though Carbon does support disabled radio buttons, their use is not generally recommended by Design System.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="disable radio buttons" story={stories.DisableRadioButtons} />
</Canvas>

### With field help

Help text for each input can be added with the `fieldHelp` prop on `RadioButton`. This can be made inline with the `fieldHelpInline` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with field help" story={stories.WithFieldHelp} />
</Canvas>

### With large radio buttons

Passing in `large` for the `size` prop on each radio button will increase the size of the button.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with large radio buttons" story={stories.WithLargeRadioButtons} />
</Canvas>

### With custom styled labels

Labels could be customized using the Typography Component

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with custom styled label" story={stories.WithCustomStyledLabels} />
</Canvas>

### Validations

Validation status can be set by passing `error`, `warning` or `info` prop to the `RadioButton` component

Passing a string to these props will display a properly colored border along with a validation icon and tooltip - string value will be displayed as the tooltip message.

Passing a boolean to these props will display only a properly colored border.

Validation status could also be passed to the `RadioButtonGroup` component as a string or boolean.
