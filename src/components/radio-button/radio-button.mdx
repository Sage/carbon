## Quick Start

To use these components, import both `RadioButtonGroup` and `RadioButton`, and pass the radio buttons as children of the radio group.

```javascript
import {
  RadioButton,
  RadioButtonGroup,
} from "carbon-react/lib/components/radio-button";
```

## Related Components

- Choosing one option from a very long list? [Try Select](/docs/select--default-story "Try Select").
- Choosing more than one option? [Try Checkbox](/docs/checkbox--default-story "Try Checkbox").
- Choosing one option from a highly visible small range? [Try Button Toggle](/story/button-toggle--default "Try Button Toggle").

## Examples

### Default

<Canvas of={RadioButtonStories.Default} />

### With legend and labels

A legend can be set for the group, and each radio button can have a label.

<Canvas of={RadioButtonStories.WithLegendAndLabels} />

### With inline legend

The legend can be made inline. Its width can be changed with the `legendWidth` prop, its text alignment with `legendAlign`.

The spacing between the legend and the radio buttons can be changed with the `legendSpacing` prop, this can be `1` or `2`, which is multiplied by the base theme spacing constant of `8px`, 
so therefore `8px` or `16px`. The default is `2` for this prop.

**Note:** The `legendInline` prop is not supported if the `validationRedesignOptIn` flag on the `CarbonProvider` is true. 

<Canvas of={RadioButtonStories.WithInlineLegend} />

### With left margin

A `ml` prop can be supplied to align the `RadioButtonGroup` with above and below components. This prop is a CSS string.

<Canvas of={RadioButtonStories.WithLeftMargin} />

### Enable adaptive behaviour

Passing in the `adaptiveLegendBreakpoint` and `adaptiveSpacingBreakpoint` props will enable the adaptive behaviour.

<Canvas of={RadioButtonStories.EnableAdaptiveBehaviour} />

### Different label spacing

The spacing between radio buttons and their labels can be changed with the `labelSpacing` prop. Similarly to the `legendSpacing` prop, this is a number which is multiplied by the base theme spacing constant. It defaults to `1` which is therefore `8px`.

<Canvas of={RadioButtonStories.DifferentLabelSpacing} />

### Inline radio buttons

The radio buttons can be made inline with the `inline` prop.

<Canvas of={RadioButtonStories.InlineRadioButtons} />

### Reverse radio buttons

The radio buttons and labels can be flipped around using the `reverse` prop on each radio button. The same spacing options between the label and radio button as above apply.

<Canvas of={RadioButtonStories.ReverseRadioButtons} />

### Disable radio buttons

The radio buttons and labels can be disabled using the `disabled` prop on each radio button.

**Please Note**: Even though Carbon does support disabled radio buttons, their use is not generally recommended by Design System.

<Canvas of={RadioButtonStories.DisableRadioButtons} />

### With field help

Help text for each input can be added with the `fieldHelp` prop on `RadioButton`. This can be made inline with the `fieldHelpInline` prop.

<Canvas of={RadioButtonStories.WithFieldHelp} />

### With large radio buttons

Passing in `large` for the `size` prop on each radio button will increase the size of the button.

<Canvas of={RadioButtonStories.WithLargeRadioButtons} />

### With custom styled labels

Labels could be customized using the Typography Component

<Canvas of={RadioButtonStories.WithCustomStyledLabels} />

### Required

You can use the `required` prop to indicate if the fields are mandatory.

<Canvas of={RadioButtonStories.Required} />

### IsOptional

You can use the `IsOptional` prop to indicate if the fields are optional.

<Canvas of={RadioButtonStories.IsOptional} />

### Validations

The folowing examples use the new validation pattern that is available by setting the `validationRedesignOptIn` flag on the `CarbonProvider` to true.

For more information check our [Validations](../?path=/docs/documentation-validations--docs) documentation page.

This is an example of `RadioButton` in a `RadioButtonGroup` with validations passed as a string.

**Note:** The `legendHelp` will be rendered as "Hint text".

<Canvas of={RadioButtonStories.NewValidationDefaultGroup} />

This is an example of `RadioButton` in a `RadioButtonGroup` with validations passed as a string displayed inline.

<Canvas of={RadioButtonStories.NewValidationDefaultGroupInline} />

This is an example of `RadioButton` with validations passed as boolean values.

<Canvas of={RadioButtonStories.NewValidationDefault} />
