## Quick Start

To use these components, import both `RadioButtonGroup` and `RadioButton`, and pass `RadioButton` as children of `RadioButtonGroup`.

```javascript
import {
  RadioButton,
  RadioButtonGroup,
} from "carbon-react/lib/components/radio-button";
```

## Examples

### With Legend

A legend can be set on the group by passing the `legend` prop to `RadioButtonGroup` with a string value.

<Canvas of={RadioButtonGroupStories.WithLegend} />

### With Legend Hint

To add a hint below the legend, pass the `legendHint` prop to `RadioButtonGroup` with a string value.

<Canvas of={RadioButtonGroupStories.WithLegendHint} />

### With Input Hint

To add a hint to an individual radio button, pass the `inputHint` prop to `RadioButton` with a string value.

<Canvas of={RadioButtonGroupStories.WithInputHint} />

### Inline

`RadioButton` children can be displayed inline by passing the `inline` prop to `RadioButtonGroup`.

<Canvas of={RadioButtonGroupStories.InlineRadioButtons} />

### Sizes

The size of the component can be changed by passing the `size` prop to `RadioButtonGroup`. Available options are `small`, `medium`, and `large`.

<Canvas of={RadioButtonGroupStories.Sizes} />

### Progressive Disclosure

`RadioButton` can be used to conditionally reveal additional content when selected. 
This can be achieved by passing the content to the `conditionalContent` prop in `RadioButton`, which accepts any valid ReactNode.

It is recommended that you provide limited amounts of content within conditionally revealed sections, if you need to disclose larger amounts of content, please consider using a different pattern.

**Please Note**: Progressive disclosure is not supported when the `inline` prop is set on `RadioButtonGroup`.

<Canvas of={RadioButtonGroupStories.ProgressiveDisclosure} />

### With Custom Labels

The `label` prop in `RadioButton` accepts a ReactNode, which allows for custom content to be displayed as the label.

<Canvas of={RadioButtonGroupStories.WithCustomLabels} />

### Required

`RadioButtonGroup` can be marked as required by passing the `required` prop.

<Canvas of={RadioButtonGroupStories.Required} />

### Disabled

`RadioButton`s can be disabled using the `disabled` prop either on the `RadioButtonGroup` to disable all radio buttons, or on individual `RadioButton`s to disable them individually.

**Please Note**: Even though Carbon does support disabled radio buttons, their use is not generally recommended by Design System.

<Canvas of={RadioButtonGroupStories.Disabled} />

## Validation States

This component supports input validation, see our [Validations](../?path=/docs/documentation-validations--docs) documentation page for more information.

## Props

**Any other supplied props in `RadioButton` will be provided to the underlying HTML input element**

<ArgTypes of={RadioButtonGroupStories} />
