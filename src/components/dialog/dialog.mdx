## Examples

### Default

The call-to-action element should always be focused when the `Dialog` is closed. However, in some instances it may not receive focus
due to specific browser design choices. The below example shows how to programmatically focus the call-to-action element when the `Dialog` is closed
to ensure behaviour is consistent across all browsers.

<Canvas of={DialogStories.DefaultStory} />

### Preventing focus from being restored when Dialog closes

When the `restoreFocusOnClose` prop is `false`, focus will not be restored to the element that was focused before the `Dialog` was opened.
Focus can instead be programmatically applied to another element if appropriate. 

<Canvas of={DialogStories.RestoreFocusOnCloseStory} />

### With Maximum Size

When the `size` prop is `"maximise"` the height and width of the `Dialog`'s modal extends to the majority of the viewport.

<Canvas of={DialogStories.MaxSize} />

### With help

<Canvas of={DialogStories.WithHelp} />

### Overriding the first focused element

By default, when a dialog is opened it will automatically focus the first element within its children that can be focussed.
However, there are a couple of ways of overriding this default behaviour. The `focusFirstElement` prop accepts a reference
to the element you wish to focus on open (an example of this can be seen by clicking the first button below). If the element
you want to focus supports `autoFocus` then the you can override the default behaviour by using the `disableAutoFocus` prop
and setting the `autoFocus` on the element you wish to be focused instead (click the second button to see an example).

<Canvas of={DialogStories.FocusingADifferentFirstElement} />

### Loading content

For situations where content cannot be rendered immediately, such as content dependent on data from an external API, conditional rendering and the `Loader` component can be used to create a loading pattern:

<Canvas of={DialogStories.LoadingContent} />

Note in the previous example, the first `Textbox` in the loaded content has autofocus, which is recommended so assistive technology users are informed of the updated content.

Alternatively, focus can be programmatically moved back to the `Dialog` if the title or subtitle has been updated as part of a content change. Most screen readers will then announce the new title indicating to users that the dialog has changed:

<Canvas of={DialogStories.UsingHandle} />

To achieve this, a custom ref handle can be forwarded to the `Dialog` component:

```tsx
const dialogHandle = useRef<DialogHandle>(null);
return (
  <Dialog title="Thank you for your feedback" ref={dialogHandle}>
    Your feedback helps us continually improve our software.
  </Dialog>
);
```

which exposes the `focus()` method of `Dialog`'s root DOM node:

```ts
dialogHandle.current?.focus();
```

### Overriding the content padding

Using the `contentPadding` prop will enable the padding of the `Dialog` content to be overridden, the example below has
set the padding to 0. Please see the [table below](#props) for more information about the values accepted by this prop.

<Canvas of={DialogStories.OverridingContentPadding} />

### Allowing other elements to be focused

Using the `focusableContainers` prop allows elements that are not DOM children of the Dialog to be reachable with the keyboard while the Dialog is open.
This may occasionally be useful with things like Toasts where they persist on the page until dismissed by clicking a close icon.

<Canvas of={DialogStories.OtherFocusableContainers} />

### Responsive Example

<Canvas of={DialogStories.Responsive} />


### Focusing Dialog Container Programmatically

```javascript
import { DialogHandle } from "carbon-react/lib/components/dialog";
```

The `DialogHandle` type provides an imperative handle for programmatic control over the `Dialog`'s container focus. 
Using a `ref`, you can access its `focus()` method to set focus on the container when needed.

<Canvas of={DialogStories.UsingHandle} />

### Top modal override

When multiple modals are open on a page Carbon manages the order internally so that the last one mounted in the DOM
is treated as the top one and the focus trap is set on it. However, this can potentially
create unexpected issues if the loading of the dialogs isn't synchronous. In order to guarantee that a given
modal is treated as top set the `topModalOverride` prop. Please note that in the scenario where this prop is
set on multiple modals, the last one mounted with it will be treated as top.

<Canvas of={DialogStories.TopModalOverride} />

### With grey background

Please note that setting the background color to grey may cause color contrast accessibility issues.

<Canvas of={DialogStories.GreyBackground} />

### Highlight variants

Setting the `highlightVariant` prop will add a highlight above the Dialog.

<Canvas of={DialogStories.HighlightVariant} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={DialogStories} />

## Translation keys

The following keys are available to override the translations for this component by passing in a custom locale object to the
[i18nProvider](../?path=/docs/documentation-i18n--docs).

<TranslationKeysTable
  translationData={[
    {
      name: "dialog.ariaLabels.close",
      description: "The text for close button aria-label attribute",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
  ]}
/>
