# Designer Notes
- Offers one more important action to the user, with some related actions also quickly accessible, but without taking up valuable space by showing them all separately.
- But, users may not always discover the related items, and could miss out.
- Useful to show about 5 options or less.
- Only use this component for buttons that are very closely related (e.g. Save, Save and Email, Save and Print, Save and New).
- Only use this component if one option is more generic or important than the others.
