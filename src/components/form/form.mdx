## Quick Start

To use Form, import the `Form` and pass the content, usually various inputs, as children.
You can provide a save button using the `saveButton` prop.

```javascript
import Form, { RequiredFieldsIndicator } from "carbon-react/lib/components/form";
```

## Examples

### With footer node

<Canvas of={FormStories.WithFooterNode} />

### With sticky footer

When `stickyFooter` prop is set as true, footer becomes stickied to the bottom of the screen when necessary - this also works in `Dialog` and `DialogFullScreen`

<Canvas of={FormStories.DefaultWithStickyFooter} />

### With sticky footer variant

<Canvas of={FormStories.StickyFooterVariant} />

### Full Width Buttons

<Canvas of={FormStories.WithFullWidthButtons} />

### Field Spacing

You can use the `fieldSpacing` prop to set the spacing between fields within `Form`, which will add a margin-bottom to supported input components. 
The value is multiplied by the base theme `8px` spacing value, by default this is set to `3`.

<Canvas of={FormStories.FieldSpacing} />

### Override spacing on a field

You can override the spacing of a field by using the `mb` prop on the specific input.

<Canvas of={FormStories.OverrideFieldSpacing} />

### Validations

When either `errorCount` or `warningCount` or both are provided, summary with the number of errors and/or warnings is rendered wrapping the save button.

<Canvas of={FormStories.WithErrorsSummary} />

<Canvas of={FormStories.WithWarningsSummary} />

<Canvas of={FormStories.WithBothErrorsAndWarningsSummary} />

### Example with required fields

Each input-based component supports a `required` prop that you can use to make it a mandatory form field. All required fields are represented with an asterisk next to their labels. To help explain the meaning of the asterisk, you can also use the `RequiredFieldsIndicator` subcomponent to display one with a supplementary description.

<Canvas name="with required fields" of={FormStories.WithRequiredFields} />

### Buttons variations

Additional buttons can be passed using `leftSideButtons` and `rightSideButtons` props.

<Canvas of={FormStories.WithAdditionalButtons} />

When `buttonAlignment` prop is set as `left`, buttons are aligned to the left side.

<Canvas of={FormStories.WithButtonsAlignedToTheLeft} />

### In Dialog

It is possible to render `Form` as a content of `Dialog` component.

<Canvas of={FormStories.InDialog} />

#### With sticky footer

<Canvas of={FormStories.InDialogWithStickyFooter} />

### In DialogFullScreen

It is possible to render `Form` as a content of `DialogFullScreen` component.

<Canvas of={FormStories.InDialogFullScreen} />

#### With sticky footer

<Canvas of={FormStories.InDialogFullScreenWithStickyFooter} />

### Form alignment

An example of how to align different kinds of input components within a `Form`. It is possible to line up all of the inputs and all of the labels in any configuration required. The spacing between inputs and labels can be `8px` or `16px`, and this can be controlled with the `labelSpacing` prop on the input components. Most of them default to `16px`

These input components are spaced vertically with the `fieldSpacing` prop on `Form`, and this can be overriden on any input component using the `mb` (margin bottom) prop.

If a component doesn't have an inline labels on the left (see the Checkboxes below), it is possible to align them using a `ml` (margin left) prop. The left margins on these components should be the same as the label width of the above and below components in order to align correctly.

Please click on "Show code" below to see how to set these components up for alignment.

### With labels inline

<Canvas of={FormStories.WithLabelsInline} />

### With custom footer padding

<Canvas of={FormStories.WithCustomFooterPadding} />

## Props

### Form

<ArgTypes of={FormStories} />

## Translation keys

The following keys are available to override the translations for this component by passing in a custom locale object to the
[i18nProvider](../?path=/docs/documentation-i18n--docs).

<TranslationKeysTable
  translationData={[
    {
      name: "error.messages.formSummary",
      description:
        "The text to displayed when there are errors or warnings present in the form",
      type: "func",
      returnType:
        "an array of strings when validation failures and null when no failures",
    },
  ]}
/>
