# Flat Table expandable options

## Examples

### Default

Flat table rows can be made expandable, with any number of sub rows.

<Canvas of={FlatTableExpandableStories.DefaultStory} />

### Keyboard accessible subrows

In order to make the subrows keyboard accessible you will need to pass a callback to the `onClick` prop as in the example
below.

<Canvas of={FlatTableExpandableStories.KeyboardAccessibleSubRows} />

### Expandable by first column only

Only clicking on the first column can expand the row with this option set.

<Canvas of={FlatTableExpandableStories.ExpandableByFirstColumnOnly} />

### With initially expanded rows

Set the rows to be open by default.

<Canvas of={FlatTableExpandableStories.InitiallyExpanded} />

### With row headers

Rows with row headers can also be made expandable. In the example below there is both a left and
right hand side sticky column. To set a column to be sticky on the left hand side set the
`stickyAlignment` prop to `left` (this is the default value) and for the right hand side sticky
columns set the prop to `right`.

<Canvas of={FlatTableExpandableStories.RowHeaders} />

### With row headers with custom paddings

Rows with row headers can also be made expandable and can also have custom paddings.
In this example `Child one` has `pl={8}` and `Child two` has `pl={5}` as well as having an icon.

### With pagination

Tables with pagination can have expandable rows.

<Canvas of={FlatTableExpandableStories.Paginated} />

### With parent and children selectable

By writing your own selectable logic, both parent and child rows can be made selectable.

<Canvas of={FlatTableExpandableStories.BothParentAndChildrenSelectable} />

### Parent only selectable

By writing your own selectable logic, the parent rows only can be made selectable.

<Canvas of={FlatTableExpandableStories.ParentOnlySelectable} />

### Children only selectable

By writing your own selectable logic, the child rows only can be made selectable.

<Canvas of={FlatTableExpandableStories.ChildrenOnlySelectable} />

### Truncated cell content

In order to achieve the content truncation when using the `expandable` feature you will need to pass in a node with the
truncated styling applied, this is because of the caret icon that is rendered within the cell.

### Controlled
