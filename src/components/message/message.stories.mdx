## Quick Start

```javascript
import Message from "carbon-react/lib/components/message";
```

## Designer Notes

Useful for messages which are longer or more important, where the user needs time to interpret them, or might need to refer back to them during an activity.

Various types are available:

- **Error** - tells the user about a negative outcome that has already happened. Try to focus the message text on the action the user needs to take to be successful, rather than what went wrong.
- **Info** - gives context or advice to the user where there’s no risk of a negative outcome.
- **Success** - indicates that an activity was successful. A good example could also present the user with onward options, such as ‘View a list of items’ or ‘Create another’.
- **Warning** - warns the user about a potential negative outcome that hasn’t happened yet.
- The Transparent configuration is useful if you’d like the message to be more visually subtle, perhaps in a Dialog.

## Related Components

- Longer, time sensitive message that must be dismissed? [Try Toast](/?path=/docs/toast--default-story "Toast").

  <Story name="with rich content" story={stories.WithRichContent} />
</Canvas>

## Translation keys

The following keys are available to override the translations for this component by passing in a custom locale object to the
[i18nProvider](https://carbon.sage.com/?path=/story/documentation-i18n--page).

<TranslationKeysTable
  translationData={[
    {
      name: "mssage.closeButtonAriaLabel",
      description: "The text for the aria-label attribute of the close button",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
  ]}
/>
