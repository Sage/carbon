  description: `A longer message which stays on screen to read and interpret.`,
  designerNotes: `
* Presents a static message which stays on screen.
* Useful for messages which are longer or more important, where the user needs time to interpret them, or might need to refer back to them during an activity.
* Various types are available. ‘Error’ and ‘Success’ are by far the most useful - others are present for completeness by may not be practically used very often:
* __Error__ - tells the user about a negative outcome that has already happened. Try to focus the message text on the action the user needs to take to be successful, rather than what went wrong.
* __Help__ - not frequently used.
* __Info__ - gives context or advice to the user where there’s no risk of a negative outcome.
* __Maintenance__ - warns the user if a particular service or feature may go offline shortly.
* __New__ - highlights a new feature to the user.
* __Success__ - indicates that an activity was successful. A good example could also present the user with onward options, such as ‘View a list of items’ or ‘Create another’.
* __Warning__ - warns the user about a potential negative outcome that hasn’t happened yet.
* The Transparent configuration is useful if you’d like the message to be more visually subtle, perhaps in a Dialog.

  relatedComponentsNotes: `
* Simple positive or negative confirmation? [Try Flash](/components/flash).
* Longer, time sensitive message that must be dismissed? [Try Toast](/components/toast).
* Error or warning message that interrupts activity? [Try Alert](/components/alert).
