# Designer Notes
- Avoid using links for commands (performing an action like saving a form) - use them for navigating the user to a new location.
- If you’re navigating the user away from your site, consider using an icon after the link, and open the link in a new window, so the user doesn’t lose their place.
- To make the meaning of a link clearer, you can add an icon before it. Just name one of the Carbon icons.
- Make your link names meaningful - for example, instead of 'Click here', try 'Download Invoice 001'.
- WCAG guidelines recommend that Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action. Carbon applies bold weight, but you could also use text decoration.
