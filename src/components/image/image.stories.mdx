# Image

Basic component that allows either the rendering of an `img` element or a `div` with a `background-image`. This component
also gives access to a number of styling options such as `margin`, and `layout`.

## Quick Start

Import the `Image` component to start using

```javascript
import Image from "carbon-react/lib/components/image";
```

## Examples

### Default

By default the component will render as a `div` element and use the `backgroundImage` to set the `background-image`
css attribute.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="default" story={stories.DefaultStory} />
</Canvas>

### As an img element

If you want to render an `img` element pass in a value to the `src` prop. The component will not accept `children` when
rendered in this way.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="as an img" story={stories.AsAnImg} />
</Canvas>

## With `hidden` prop

To hide the component completely - meaning hidden visually and from being accessible via keyboard navigation or a screen reader - the `hidden` prop can be passed. The underlying element remains in the DOM but is semantically hidden.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with hidden prop" story={stories.WithHiddenProp} />
</Canvas>

### Decorative Image

There may be a use case where a decorative image is required. Decorative images do not add information to the content of a page. 
For example, a decorative image might be included to make the website more visually attractive. 

In these cases, an empty alt text should be provided (alt="") so that they can be ignored by assistive technologies, such as screen readers.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="decorative" story={stories.DecorativeStory} />
</Canvas>

### Custom responsive behaviour

It is possible to conditionally change the props based on defined breakpoints in the example below. This example is best
viewed in the Canvas tab using full-screen mode with device or viewport emulation.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="custom responsive behaviour"
    story={stories.CustomResponsiveBehaviour}
  />
</Canvas>

## Props

### Image

<StyledSystemProps of={Image} margin layout background noHeader />
