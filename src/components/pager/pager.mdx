## Quick Start

```javascript
import Pager from "carbon-react/lib/components/pager";
```

## Examples

### Default

<Canvas of={PagerStories.Default} name="default" />

### with interactivePageNumber

When the `interactivePageNumber` prop is `false` the number input which contains the current
page number is replaced with a non-interactive label which will include the current page, and total page count all in one string.

<Canvas of={PagerStories.InteractivePageNumber} name="interactivePageNumber" />

### with hideDisabledElements

The example below demonstrates the functionality of the `hideDisabledElements` prop, when `true` all elements that typically would be disabled
are instead hidden. This prop can be used in conjunction with all other `Pager` props and functionality.

<Canvas of={PagerStories.HideDisabledElements} name="hideDisabledElements" />

### With disabled Page Size Selection

<Canvas of={PagerStories.DisabledPageSize} />

### Hiding Pager elements

Unlike with hiding the page size select component, the remaining elements that make up the `Pager` are rendered by
default: in order for them to be hidden you must pass `false` to the corresponding `show...` prop (see prop table below).
In the example below the `First` and `Last` buttons and `totalRecords` label have been hidden by setting the
`showFirstAndLastButtons` and `showTotalRecords` props to false.

<Canvas of={PagerStories.HidingPagerElements} />

### Smart elements

The examples below demonstrate the `Pager`'s smart functionality. In the first there are only enough records for one page,
and as such the navigation buttons are not necessary and therefore not rendered. In the second example there are only enough
records for two pages, the `First` and `Last` buttons are not needed and as a result will not render.

### Loading state

When no totalRecords provided.

<Canvas of={PagerStories.LoadingState} />

### Custom pageSizeSelectionOptions

Show custom page size selection options.

<Canvas of={PagerStories.PageSizeSelectionOptions} />

### With currentPage pre-set to last page

Due to the fact that it is last page, next and last links are disabled.

<Canvas of={PagerStories.CurrentPageLastPage} />

### With currentPage pre-set to page 5

<Canvas of={PagerStories.CurrentPage} />

### Custom responsive example

The`show...` props can be used to implement responsive behaviour in the `Pager`. Below is an example that will
conditionally render the internal elements as the screen size is adjusted. This example is best viewed in the Canvas tab
using full-screen mode with device or viewport emulation.

<Canvas of={PagerStories.UsingCustomResponsiveSettings} />

### Small screen breakpoint
The `smallScreenBreakpoint` prop allows you to set the screen size at which the `Pager` will switch to small screen layout. 
This will cause the navigation links to wrap onto a new line if `showPageSizeSelection` or `showTotalRecords` is set to `true`, as well as reduce the spacing around the elements.

**Note:** This prop does not guarantee that the elements within `Pager` do not overflow, it is up to consumers to ensure they set the appropriate props and breakpoints.

## Translation keys

The following keys are available to override the translations for this component by passing in a custom locale object to the
[i18nProvider](../?path=/docs/documentation-i18n--docs).

<TranslationKeysTable
  translationData={[
    {
      name: "pager.show",
      description:
        "The text to display before the totalRecords select component",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
    {
      name: "pager.records",
      description:
        "The text to display after the totalRecords select component",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
    {
      name: "pager.first",
      description:
        "The text to display for the button that navigates to the first page of records",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
    {
      name: "pager.last",
      description:
        "The text to display for the button that navigates to the last page of records",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
    {
      name: "pager.next",
      description:
        "The text to display for the button that navigates to the next page of records",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
    {
      name: "pager.previous",
      description:
        "The text to display for the button that navigates to the previous page of records",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
    {
      name: "pager.pageX",
      description:
        "The text to display before the current page input component",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
    {
      name: "pager.ofY",
