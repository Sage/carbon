# Designer Notes

- Useful for collecting a significant amount of text (e.g. notes about clients, or a short email message).
- Only handles plain text at this time - not markup or markdown, but it does handle line breaks.
- If content in a textarea is read-only, remove the field border so it appears as static text.
- Use placeholder text to give the user context or examples of what to write.
