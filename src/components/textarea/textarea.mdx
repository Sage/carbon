- Useful for collecting a significant amount of text (e.g. notes about clients, or a short email message).
- If content in a textarea is read-only, remove the field border so it appears as static text.
- Use placeholder text to give the user context or examples of what to write.

import Textarea from "carbon-react/lib/components/textarea";
```

### With characterLimit

If you use the `inputHint` prop to provide the user with a hint before the input, please use a full stop `.` at the end,
as it forces a pause before any other announcements, this well help screen reader users understand the hint fully.

<Canvas of={TextareaStories.CharacterLimitStory} />

### with characterLimit - with translations

Various translations can be applied to both the visually hidden hint message, and the character
counter below the input.

These translations have been split up to include a number which represents the current character count which
is over/under the set `characterLimit`. Please see below how this has been achieved with a French translation.
Include the formatted number count wherever makes sense for the language you're translating too.

<Canvas of={TextareaStories.TranslationsCharacterLimitStory} />

### With labelInline

**Note:** The `labelInline` prop is not supported if the `validationRedesignOptIn` flag on the `CarbonProvider` is true. 

<Canvas of={TextareaStories.LabelInlineStory} />

### Label Align

<Canvas of={TextareaStories.LabelAlignStory} />

### With custom labelWidth and inputWidth

<Canvas of={TextareaStories.CustomWidthStory} />

### With custom maxWidth

<Canvas of={TextareaStories.MaxWidthStory} />

### With fieldHelp

<Canvas of={TextareaStories.FieldHelpStory} />

### With inputHint

When the `inputHint` prop is passed, please use a full stop `.` at the end. This forces a pause
before any other announcements, this well help screen reader users understand the hint fully.

<Canvas of={TextareaStories.InputHintStory} />

### With labelHelp

<Canvas of={TextareaStories.LabelHelpStory} />

### Required

You can use the `required` prop to indicate if the field is mandatory.

<Canvas of={TextareaStories.RequiredStory} />

### IsOptional

You can use the `optional` prop to indicate if the field is optional.

<Canvas of={TextareaStories.IsOptionalStory} />

#### Customer Border Radius

The `borderRadius` prop accepts either a single design token, or an array of them, that will be applied as the CSS `border-radius` property.
See [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius) for examples of how this works with multiple values.

<Canvas of={TextareaStories.BorderRadiusStory} />

#### Borderless Textarea

If you want to remove the borders from the component, you can use the `hideBorders` prop. This will still apply the border styling for validations and also the focus styling to the component.

<Canvas of={TextareaStories.BorderlessExample} />

### Validations

Validation status can be set by passing `error`, `warning` or `info` prop to the component.

Passing a string to these props will display a properly colored border along with a validation icon and tooltip - string value will be displayed as the tooltip message.

Passing a boolean to these props will display only a properly colored border.

For more information check our [Validations](../?path=/docs/documentation-validations--docs) documentation page.

#### As a string
