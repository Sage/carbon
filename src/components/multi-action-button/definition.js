  designerNotes: `
* Offers related actions to the user, but without taking up valuable space by showing them separately.
* But, users may not always discover them, and could miss out.
* Useful to show about 5 options or less.
* Only use this component for commands that are related (e.g. Export PDF, Export CSV).
* Donâ€™t use this component if one option is more generic or important than the others.
* Carbon has a Transparent configuration, with subtle visual style, which could be useful to present less important or infrequently used options to the user, without calling attention to them.
  `,
  relatedComponentsNotes: `
* Performing a single action? [Try Button](/components/button).
* Range of buttons where one is more important? [Try Split Button](/components/split-button).
* Choosing one option from a highly visible range? [Try Button Toggle](/components/button-toggle).
