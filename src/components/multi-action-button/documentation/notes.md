# Designer Notes
- Offers related actions to the user, but without taking up valuable space by showing them separately.
- But, users may not always discover them, and could miss out.
- Useful to show about 5 options or less.
- Only use this component for commands that are related (e.g. Export PDF, Export CSV).
- Donâ€™t use this component if one option is more generic or important than the others.
- Carbon has a Transparent configuration, with subtle visual style, which could be useful to present less important or infrequently used options to the user, without calling attention to them.
