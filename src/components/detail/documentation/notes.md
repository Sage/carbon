# Designer Notes
- Useful to present some important text with prominence, for example, a quote, instruction, or callout.
- Optional icon and footnote.
- Make sure that the colour of all text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5.1, to meet the [WCAG 2.0 AA standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html "WCAG 2.0 AA standard") for text less than 19px in size. Webaim have a good online [Contrast Checker](http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ "Contrast Checker").
