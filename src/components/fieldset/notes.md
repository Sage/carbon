# Designer Notes
- You can nest any Carbon input into this component.
- Useful for presenting a series of inputs that are closely related, within a wider Form or Pod (e.g. an address or contact details).
- Configure Pod and Fieldset components to work together, or choose the pre-configured Show/Edit Pod component.
 -The Show/Edit Pod component automatically presents content as a read-only Pod, until the user clicks an edit icon, which shows the same information in an editable Fieldset.
- But, configuring Pod and Fieldset components manually will give you more customization options, like the following.
- Top-aligned labels (Carbon default) or inline right-aligned labels are usually fastest for users.
- Create a single path to completion with your inputs, and between your inputs and the primary action Button.
- Indicate mandatory, or optional fields, whichever is the minority. Think carefully before collecting optional data - don’t collect information you don’t need! Try suffixing ‘(optional)’ after your field label.
- More guidance is available for each of the individual inputs you might place inside this component.
