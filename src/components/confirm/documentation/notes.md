# Designer Notes
- Shows a static message in a dialog which asks the user to confirm or cancel an action theyâ€™ve initiated.
- Useful to confirm actions which may be difficult to undo, or potentially harmful.
- Include a Message component within the Alert component (a warning Message component may be particularly useful for a potentially harmful choice), use plain text, or apply a standard Carbon Error or Warning icon.
- This component has the same options and properties as the Dialog component.
- A good example could be confirming deletion of a large number of records.
