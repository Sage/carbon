# Have I got the right component?
- Is there a natural order to the data, and do users need to sort or filter? Try a [list](/components/list "List") or [table](/components/table "Table").

# What configurations are available?
- [Cards](/components/card "Card"): contain interactive content or controls. Sometimes it might be possible to move them around on the page. They have shadows - 'card shadow' as a default, and depth level 1 on hover.
- Tiles: contain static content for visual scanning only, and don't contain controls. Tiles don't have shadows.

# Guidance, hints and tips
- [Cards](/components/card "Card") may have hover and dragging states, whereas tiles do not.
- Neither [cards](/components/card "card") nor tiles scroll.
- The primary action area of a [card](/components/card "card") is typically the [card](/components/card "card") itself. Often [cards](/components/card "card") are one large touch target to a detail screen on a subject.
- When an array of [cards](/components/card "card") or tiles are shown together, they may wrap into a grid depending on the available width and height of their container.
