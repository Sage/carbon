# Designer Notes
- Useful to perform an action in context without navigating the user to a separate page.
- Useful if the user might need to refer back to the page behind the sidebar. For example, the user could select from a list of clients on the page, with detailed information on the client loading in the sidebar.
- Several pre-set widths are available, and the height is always 100%. It’s best to avoid sidebars that are taller than the user’s viewport height, as a scroll would hide some information. Typical user viewport heights can be as little as 650 pixels.
- Choose whether a dark tint is applied behind the dialog which helps to focus the user on the sidebar, but don’t select this option if the user needs to refer back to the underlying page.
