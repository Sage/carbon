## Quick Start

```javascript
import Sidebar from "carbon-react/lib/components/sidebar";
```

- Sidebar is positioned on the right hand screen of the window by default. To position the sidebar on the left hand side pass `position='left'` to the component.

- The background behind the sidebar is disabled by default. To allow the user to interact with all the UI pass `enableBackgroundUI={ true }` to the component

## Examples

### Default

<Canvas of={SidebarStories.DefaultStory} />

### Custom padding around content

<Canvas of={SidebarStories.CustomPaddingAroundContent} />

### With header

<Canvas of={SidebarStories.WithHeader} />

### With scroll

If sidebar content does not fit the sidebar, scroll will appear. Default scroll theme is "light".

<Canvas of={SidebarStories.WithScroll} />

### With Typography

<Canvas of={SidebarStories.WithTypography} />

### Allowing other elements to be focused

Using the `focusableContainers` prop allows elements that are not DOM children of the Sidebar to be reachable with the keyboard while the Sidebar is open.
This may occasionally be useful with things like Toasts where they persist on the page until dismissed by clicking a close icon.
(In the example below, try clicking the cancel and/or save buttons and notice how you can navigate across one or both toasts as well as the sidebar using the keyboard.)

<Canvas of={SidebarStories.OtherFocusableContainers} />

### Custom width

It is possible to set a custom width for the `Sidebar` via the `width` [prop](#props).
Setting this prop will override the preset width value defined via the `size` prop.

<Canvas of={SidebarStories.CustomWidth} />

### With header and footer padding overridden

<Canvas of={SidebarStories.WithHeaderAndFooterPadding} />

### Top modal override

When multiple modals are open on a page Carbon manages the order internally so that the last one mounted in the DOM
is treated as the top one and the focus trap is set on it. However, this can potentially
create unexpected issues if the loading of the dialogs isn't synchronous. In order to guarantee that a given
modal is treated as top set the `topModalOverride` prop. Please note that in the scenario where this prop is
set on multiple modals, the last one mounted with it will be treated as top.

## Translation keys

The following keys are available to override the translations for this component by passing in a custom locale object to the
[i18nProvider](../?path=/docs/documentation-i18n--docs).

<TranslationKeysTable
  translationData={[
    {
      name: "sidebar.ariaLabels.close",
      description: "The text for close button aria-label attribute",
      type: "func",
      returnType: "string",
    },
  ]}
/>
