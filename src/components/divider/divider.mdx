## Quick Start

To use component, import the `Divider` and align it with the other components.

```javascript
import Divider from "carbon-react/lib/components/divider";
```

## Examples

### Default
The `Divider` component defaults to the `vertical` type, which spans the full height (`100%`) and includes `24px` of padding. When set to `horizontal`, it spans the full width (`100%`) and applies `24px` margins to the top and bottom.

### In a flex container

It is possible to set a custom height for `vertical` type of the component by passing a value to the `h` prop as either a number or a string:
if passing a number the height will be set in pixels; if passing a string you will need to ensure you provide the measurement unit.

### In a non-flex container

When using the component in a non-flex container you can set the `displayInline` prop to true (default is false). This will
add the css attribute `display: inline;` to the component.

### With custom spacing and height

The `p` prop allows for the spacing on all sides to be customised. The `pt` and `pb` props set the vertical spacing and
the `pr` and `pr` props set the horizontal spacing. These props can be number mulitipliers of the base
theme spacing which is `8px`, or any valid CSS string. The default for the `p` prop is `3` and therefore `24px`.

### With different vertical spacing

The `mb` and `mt` props set the vertical spacing. These props are multipliers and are therefore multiplied by the base theme spacing which is `8px`. The default for both is `3` and therefore `24px`.

### In a Dialog

### In a Tile

### In a grid container

This example is best viewed in the Canvas tab using full-screen mode with device or viewport emulation.

<Canvas of={DividerStories.InGridContainer} />

### In a table

<Canvas of={DividerStories.InATable} />

### In a Menu

<Canvas of={DividerStories.InAMenu} />

### Inside a form

<Canvas of={DividerStories.InsideForm} />

### Inside a form with inline labels

<Canvas of={DividerStories.InsideFormInlineLabels} />

### Enabling the adaptive behaviour

The left and right margins can be set to 0 below a screen width breakpoint. This can be switched on with the `adaptiveMxBreakpoint` prop by passing in a number corresponding to a px value screen width.
