# Designer Notes
- Useful if the user has a choice between a small number of options, that you’d like to be highly visible (e.g. choosing between three or fewer subscription packages, with short names).
- To make the meaning of an option clearer, you can add an icon to it. Just name one of the Carbon icons.
