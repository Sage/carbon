## Quick Start

```javascript
import {
  ButtonToggle,
  ButtonToggleGroup,
} from "carbon-react/lib/components/button-toggle";
```

## Examples

### Default

<Canvas of={ButtonToggleStories.Default} />

### With inputHint

<Canvas of={ButtonToggleStories.InputHint} />

### With aria-label

If you do not want a visible label to appear above the group, you should pass the `aria-label` prop to `ButtonToggleGroup` to give it an
accessible name to be announced by screen readers. Failure to do this will result in accessibility violations.

<Canvas of={ButtonToggleStories.AriaLabel} />

### With fullWidth

When the `fullWidth` prop is `true`, the buttons will expand in size to evenly take up the full width of the container.

<Canvas of={ButtonToggleStories.FullWidth} />

### Allowing deselection

By default, in a `ButtonToggleGroup` there is no way to deselect the currently-selected toggle button except by selecting another one.
The `allowDeselect` prop changes this behaviour, making it possible for there to be no selection.

If you use this, you should include text in the `inputHint` prop which makes clear that deselection is allowed, as in the example below.

<Canvas of={ButtonToggleStories.AllowDeselection} />

### Small icon

<Canvas of={ButtonToggleStories.DefaultSmallIcon} />

### Large icon

<Canvas of={ButtonToggleStories.DefaultLargeIcon} />

### Icon only

While we do not advocate the use of icon-only buttons for accessibility reasons, the `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` props can be passed to
an icon-only `ButtonToggle` so that assistive technology users are aware of the action that will be taken when the button is pressed.

<Canvas of={ButtonToggleStories.IconOnly} />

### Small

<Canvas of={ButtonToggleStories.Small} />

### Small with small icon

<Canvas of={ButtonToggleStories.SmallSmallIcon} />

### Small with large icon

<Canvas of={ButtonToggleStories.SmallLargeIcon} />

### Large

<Canvas of={ButtonToggleStories.Large} />

### Large with small icon

<Canvas of={ButtonToggleStories.LargeSmallIcon} />

### Large with large icon

<Canvas of={ButtonToggleStories.LargeLargeIcon} />

### Disabled Button

<Canvas of={ButtonToggleStories.DisabledButton} />

### Disabled Group

<Canvas of={ButtonToggleStories.DisabledGroup} />

### Wrapped Group

When buttons can no longer fit in a single row, they will wrap onto the next line.
The `fullWidth` prop can provide a more consistent layout across different screen sizes, so we recommend using it if buttons are likely to wrap in smaller screens.

<Canvas of={ButtonToggleStories.WrappedButtons} />

## Props

### Button Toggle Group

<ArgTypes of={ButtonToggleGroupStories} />
