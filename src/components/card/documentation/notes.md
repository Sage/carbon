# Designer Notes
- Cards: contain interactive content or controls. Sometimes it might be possible to move them around on the page. They have shadows - 'card shadow' as a default, and depth level 1 on hover.
- Cards may have hover and dragging states, whereas tiles do not.
- Neither cards nor tiles scroll.
- The primary action area of a card is typically the card itself. Often cards are one large touch target to a detail screen on a subject.
- When an array of cards or tiles are shown together, they may wrap into a grid depending on the available width and height of their container.
