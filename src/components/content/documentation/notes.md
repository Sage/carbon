# Designer Notes
- Useful to show simple text content in a common arrangement.
- Shows a title in bold, with plain text content children.
- Make sure that the colour of all text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5.1, to meet the WCAG 2.0 AA standard for text less than 19px in size. Webaim have a good online Contrast Checker.
