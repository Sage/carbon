  designerNotes: `
* You can nest any Carbon input into this component.
* Carbon gives you standard Save and Cancel buttons with this component.
* A great source of knowledge for creating excellent web forms comes from Luke Wroblewski.
* Top-aligned labels (Carbon default) or inline right-aligned labels are usually fastest for users.
* Try to create a single path to completion with your inputs, and between your inputs and the primary action Button - there’s good evidence users complete forms faster like this.
* If an input is read-only, remove the field border so it appears as static text.
* You can disable components in forms, but try to avoid this. If you need to, make it clear what the user needs to do, in order to activate the component.
* Indicate mandatory, or optional fields, whichever is the minority. Think carefully before collecting optional data - don’t collect information you don’t need! Try suffixing ‘(optional)’ after your field label.
* More guidance is available for each of the individual inputs you might place inside this component.
