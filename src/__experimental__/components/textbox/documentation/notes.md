# Designer Notes

- Use placeholder text to give the user examples of data formats (e.g. AB123456C for a UK National Insurance number).
- Use prefixes if your data always begins with a certain sequence (e.g. a UK VAT number usually starts with ‘GB’).
- If content in a textbox is never editable, think about removing the field border so it appears as static text.
- You can disable a textbox, but try to avoid this. If you need to, make it clear what the user needs to do in order to activate the textbox.
- Use wider fields for longer data (e.g. an address line), and narrower fields for shorter data (e.g. a postcode), to give the user a clue about the data expected.
