# Designer Notes
- Behaves like a simple browser menu control - the user can select an item using the mouse or keyboard.
- Useful to show more than about 5 options.
- Use placeholder content like ‘Please select…’ to make it clear to the user that the Dropdown is unset.
- Consider a ‘smart default’ selection, based on what your user is likely to choose. But, users may well leave the defaults in place, so make sure any consequences are easy to undo, and not harmful.
