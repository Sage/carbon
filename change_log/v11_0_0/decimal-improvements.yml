Breaking Changes:
- "The onChange and onBlur interfaces now dispatch an object instead of the SyntheticEvent. The decimal
value can be accessed from `e.target.value.rawValue` or `e.target.value.formattedValue`. (Component: Decimal)"
- "Event utils now prefer `key` over the deprecated `which` property. There should be no noticeable changes when called
with a SyntheticEvent."
New Features:
  - "allow an empty value using the `allowEmptyValue` prop, this will default to '' instead of '0.00' (Component: Decimal)"
  - "entering a negative symbol only and blurring will revert to the default value ('' or '0.00') (Component: Decimal)"
  - "re-add hidden input that has the `name` and unformatted value (Component: Decimal)"
Bug Fixes:
  - "allow the value of the component to be set by updating the `value` prop externally (Component: Decimal)"
  - "allow the user to modify a controlled value (Component: Decimal)"
  - "prevent the cursor from moving unless by the user, it would previously move then re-position itself (Component: Decimal)"
  - "fire onChange when restoring a default value e.g. when the user deletes the value and it is defaulted to '0.00' (Component: Decimal)"
