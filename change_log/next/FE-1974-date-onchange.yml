New Features: "(Component: DateInput) wrapped with the `withUniqueName`/HOC. Added `name` property to action/onChange event."
Other: "Renamed `Date` component to `DateInput` to avoid ambiguity with JavaScript's `Date`. 
(Component: Form) Updates to Form component to use `Form` and `FormWithValidations` instead of `FormWithoutValidations`
and `FormWithValidations` to avoid having `withValidations(FormWithoutValidations)` in various cases,
were objects would read `FormWithoutValidations` but have validation. Updated tests and coverage for Form.
(Component: withUniqueName) Updates to `withUniqueName` component to forwardRef to allow access to components wrapped with it.
(Component: DateRange), Updates to component to reflect Date chaniging to DateInput and bein wrapped `withUniqueName`."
