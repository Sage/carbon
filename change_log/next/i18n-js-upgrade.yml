Dependency Updates: |
  Upgrades i18n-js dependency to the latest version from npm, rather than using the v3 release candidate from tar.gz. There is a change in this release that means any externally defined translations are not shared on the same I18n instance, if you need to do this we suggest you enable the imports-loader in webpack


  // ./webpack.config.js

  module.exports = {
    ...
    module: {
      rules: [
        {
           test: require.resolve('i18n-js'),
           use: 'imports-loader?this=>window'
        }
      ]
     
  };
