Dependency Updates: |
  Upgrades i18n-js dependency to the latest version from NPM, rather than using the v3 release candidate from tar.gz. There is a change in this release that means any externally defined translations are not shared on the same I18n instance, if you need to do this we recommend merging your translations together

  import { merge } from 'lodash';
  import I18n from 'i18n-js';
  I18n.translations = merge(global.I18n.translations, I18n.translations);
