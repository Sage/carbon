## Setting up dev environment

To help you get setup for working on Carbon, we have a [dev environment setup guide](contributing/dev-environment-setup.md) with more information.

## Codebase Overview

More details can be found in our [Codebase Overview](contributing/codebase-overview.md) guide.

## Testing

More details about how we test can be found in our [Testing Guide](contributing/testing-guide.md).

## Bugs

### Where to find known issues

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Sage/carbon/issues) to keep track of incoming bugs and enhancement requests. Before you raise a new issue, please have a look to see if your problem does not already exist.

### Reporting an issue

Please provide as much as possible to help us replicate and understand the problem. The best way to do this is to provide a sandbox that reproduces the issue. We have a starter template to help you do this:

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/Parsium/carbon-starter)

### Proposing a large change

Most bug fixes and enhancements are trivial and can be implemented and raised as a pull request as normal. For larger, complex changes however, we ask if an [Request for Comments (RFC)](rfcs/README.md) is raised first.

## Raising a Pull Request

We accept two standard workflows for raised pull requests:

- **Feature branch** workflow - for internal Sage contributors with access rights to the repository. Features should be developed in a branch off `master` and a pull request raised to merge into back into `master`.
- **Forking** workflow - for third-party contributors outside Sage. You should fork the repository and make your changes there, then raise a pull request to merge back into the Carbon `master` branch.

## Semantic Versioning

Carbon uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) - we release major versions for breaking changes, minor versions for new features or non-essential changes, and patch versions for critical bugfixes.

We automate our release process by standardising our git commit messages using the [`conventional-commits`](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format, and the [`semantic-release`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-release) package - which uses commit messages to determine the next version number, generate release notes, and publish a new version.

## Git commit messages

Following the [`conventional-commits`](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format, all commit messages should be structured as below.

```none
<type>([optional scope]): <description>
<BLANK LINE>
[optional body]
<BLANK LINE>
[optional footer]
```

Carbon accepts the following commit types, shown with the corresponding release that is generated using `semantic-release`:

| Type        | Description                                                                                                 | Release Type |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `feat:`     | Introduce a new feature                                                                                     | minor        |
| `fix:`      | A bug fix                                                                                                   | patch        |
| `docs:`     | Documentation only changes                                                                                  | :x:          |
| `style:`    | Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)      | :x:          |
| `refactor:` | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature                                                   | :x:          |
| `perf:`     | A code change that improves performance                                                                     | patch        |
| `test:`     | Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests                                                           | :x:          |
| `build:`    | Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)         | :x:          |
| `ci:`       | Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs) | :x:          |
| `chore:`    | Other changes that don't modify src or test files                                                           | :x:          |
| `revert:`   | Reverts a previous commit                                                                                   | patch        |

### Denoting a breaking change

Any of the types in the previous table can trigger a **major** release by including `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the commit footer, or appending a `!` after the type/scope.

### Messages are validated on commit

Messages are automatically validated against the `conventional-commit` guidelines when a commit is made. We use [`commitlint`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) and [`husky`](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to do this.

- [`husky`](https://github.com/typicode/husky) manages the git commit hooks defined in `package.json`
- we have a hook that runs the commit message via [`commitlint`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint)
- we use the [`@commitlint/config-conventional`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional) config
- [`husky`](https://github.com/typicode/husky) aborts the commit if the commit message is in the wrong format
